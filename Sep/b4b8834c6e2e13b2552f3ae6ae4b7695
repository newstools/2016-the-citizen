Dar es Salaam. The Tanzania Zambia Railway Authority (Tazara) has agreed with railway operators of Zambia and DR Congo to review operations among the three railways to facilitate movement of goods across the three national boundaries. In 2013, Tazara, Zambia Railways Limited and Societe Nationale Des Chemins De Fer Du Congo Sarl signed an agreement to harmonise their operations. Now, the three companies have agreed to formulate strategies to maintain seamless operations. Due to inefficiencies and other challenges that characterised the railways in the past, many customers had abandoned the railways and there is now an urgent need to re-assure customers that things have changed to win back their confidence, said three railway CEOs in a joint statement. To remain competitive and keep our institutions sustainable, it is necessary that we make known some of our challenges to our governments for their attention and resolution, where possible. They also agreed that to win back the confidence of their customers, it was necessary to eliminate bottlenecks. The companies also agreed to come up with strategies to raise traffic volumes. Operations must be reviewed to make their services as attractive as possible to customers, the statement said. The two Governments of the United Republic of Tanzania and the Republic of Zambia hold the shares of Tazara on a joint and equal basis.
