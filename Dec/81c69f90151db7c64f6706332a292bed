Presenters Thando &#8216;Thabooty&#8217; Thabethe and Boitumelo &#8216;Boity&#8217; Thulo have posted a picture of themselves in bikinis, and Instagram is going crazy. In fact, most of their fans say it will take some time to process what they&#8217;ve seen. We&#8217;ve seen Thando&#8217;s booty in one photo, but both hers and Boity&#8217;s in one? So we forgive Instagram for going crazy about the post. Check out the picture Boity posted on Instagram below: Hey @thando_thabethe &#x1f60d;&#x1f351;&#x1f445;&#x1f48b;&#x1f4a6;&#x1f451; #OhShip2016 A photo posted by Boitumelo Thulo (@boity) on Dec 4, 2016 at 6:52am PST Of course there were those who complained that the picture was too much. One of their followers said it was just a matter of time before we started seeing pornographic images on Instagram. Bonang Matheba and Lorna Maseko also posted pictures of themselves in bikinis and set social media alight. Check out Bonang&#8217;s Instagram post below: Fridays.
