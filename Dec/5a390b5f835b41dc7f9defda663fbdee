A tip-off to members of the Tshwane Metro Police Department (TMPD) about a vehicle selling dagga early on Tuesday morning led them to a house where they busted a female dealer and uncovered dagga worth R1.65 million. TMPD spokesperson Senior Superintendent Isaac Mahamba said metro police officers managed to stop the vehicle on the M17 road and found a male driver with dagga valued at R207.50. Upon further questioning, the driver led the officers to the dealer&#8217;s house in Hebron, north of Pretoria. The officers approached the house, and they found that the dealer is a woman. Inside the house they found many bags of dagga with the street value of R1.65 million, Mahamba said. He said both the man and the woman was arrested for dealing and possession of dagga and will appear in court soon. Mahamba said we are very proud of the wonderful work done by the officers and will continue to combat crime in the City of Tshwane&#8221;.
