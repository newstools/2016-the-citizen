A case of attempted murder has been opened after two policemen, one from KwaDabeka Police Station and another from the Durban K9 Unit, were shot by alleged hijackers in Clermont in KwaZulu-Natal. KwaDabeka police spokesperson Captain Mazwi Mbatha said the officers were following up on information about a Jeep that had been stolen in Pinetown when a group of armed men opened fire on the officers on 29th Avenue. It is believed the gang had, in a separate incident, hijacked a Nissan NP200 from the same area. It is not clear if the alleged hijackers were involved in the theft of the Jeep, Highway Mail reported. We suspect that the men in the Nissan thought police were looking for that car and started shooting at the police. The K9 Unit then called for backup, and officers from KwaDabeka SAPS crime prevention unit responded. The Durban K9 Unit officer was shot in the hand, and the KwaDabeka constable was shot in the hand and in the stomach, said Mbatha. The two officers were taken to hospital, and the men fled the scene on foot. Mbatha said a R5 rifle and ammunition were found in the car. &#8211; Caxton News Service
