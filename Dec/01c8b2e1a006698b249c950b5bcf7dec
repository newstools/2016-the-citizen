Black First Land First (BLF) leader Andile Mngxitama took to Facebook on Wednesday morning to declare that even though former University of Cape Town (UCT) SRC president Amanda Gwen Ngwenya had &#8220;sold us out&#8221;, she had &#8220;made her fake degrees work for her&#8221;. This despite the fact that Ngwenya&#8217;s qualifications have not been questioned before, aside from apparently unsubstantiated allegations on social media, primarily from a Twitter user known as Macua wa ma Guerrila (@KamauMacua) about her allegedly misrepresenting her qualifications. The user claims her documents are &#8220;suspicious&#8221;. COO of SAIRR claims to have Law and Economics degrees. She gave suspicious docs. @UnivParisEst @UCT_news confirm? #AmandaDegrees #AmandaGate pic.twitter.com/WATNZwss52 &mdash; Macua wa ma Guerrila (@KamauMacua) December 24, 2016 Ngwenya&#8217;s public profile says she holds a master s degree in economics from the University of Paris. She is the chief operating officer at the SA Institute of Race Relations. According to Mngxitama, however, all &#8220;white people degrees&#8221; cannot be considered authentic anyway because white people have forced their imperialist culture on black people. Ngwenya has been under attack for taking a position against some of the Fees Must Fall protesters and their demands, and for opposing UCT vice-chancellor Max Price and calling for a vote of no confidence against Price earlier this month. She explained in the middle of December that the university&#8217;s executive was appeasing &#8220;student lawbreakers and ideologues who have not been able to articulate their philosophy in any manner as to result in its common comprehension&#8221;. She has been criticised for supporting the &#8220;conservative position&#8221; by those on the side of the Fallists and for betraying black people. She said she had been expecting to be called a &#8220;house negro&#8221;. Was only a matter of time before I was called a house negroe. And here we are as expected. https://t.co/IbiMhMtvQH Gwen Ngwenya (@GwenNgwenya) December 16, 2016 She also took to Twitter last week to point out the apparent absurdity that a black waiter had been fired for allegedly being racist. Black man fired for writing &#39;2 blacks&#39;. I thought black people can&#39;t be racist? Glad that&#39;s settled. Identity politics will destroy itself. &mdash; Gwen Ngwenya (@GwenNgwenya) December 21, 2016 Now Mngxitama has launched a volley of sarcasm at the former DA Youth leader for &#8220;fooling the white system&#8221;. He wrote: &#8220;Amanda Ngwenya ke bosso! i think she must be condemned for selling us out but praised for fooling the white system. she did exceptionally well, she made her fake degrees work for her. You think white people degrees are authentic? think again! all white degrees are fake! think about it, you oppress a people, take their land, destroy their culture, kill their gods, force them to speak your language, trapped them in poverty, make them worry about fees, force a foreign curriculum on them and then turn around say its a meritocratic system? THINKING BLACK! [sic all]&#8221; Mngxitama has also recently explained the reason he has been supporting President Jacob Zuma is because he is &#8220;thinking black&#8221;. Although he does not agree with the ANC or support Zuma unconditionally, he believes Zuma has been under attack from Western imperialism and Mngxitama&#8217;s enemies, Johann Rupert and the Oppenheimers. Watch him explain his thinking in the video below: Mngxitama says he always supports black people when they are attacked by white people, regardless of whether he likes them or agrees with their views. He also wrote that the &#8220;DA agent&#8221; Ngwenya and other &#8220;house nigger&#8221; &#8220;sellouts&#8221;, such as Cyril Ramaphosa and Mmusi Maimane, needed to be engaged with as &#8220;sinners&#8221;. &#8220;On our part, we must always be ready to engage those who have fallen into the white sin. Amanda can lead by proactively apologizing to us blacks and we in turn its our duty to forgive and protect her.&#8221; He said: &#8220;I and some of my comrades don&#8217;t agree fully on how to handle the Amanda (DA functionary) exposed for misrepresenting her academic achievements which she used to advance the white agenda.&#8221; Mngxitama and his party will be starting 2017 by continuing their fight to retrieve the R26 billion Mngxitama has alleged was stolen from government by Rupert and other businesspeople more than 20 years ago. &#8220;When [public protector] advocate Mkhwebane opens her e-mail in the new year she will find a letter from BLF requesting a meeting. We have allowed the new public protector to settle in; now we moving on the urgent matter of the R26 billion. &#8220;Johann Rupert and his agents must know we aren&#8217;t going to rest until they pay back the money. [Former public protector] Advocate Madonsela protected white capital to the end. But its not the end of the story for us. On February 02 the BLF 26 will be in court again. 2017 is going to be busy!&#8221; The 26 BLF members he was referring to were arrested for storming the public protector&#8217;s offices earlier this year to demand an audience with Madonsela, but she was not there. They were arrested for trespassing and are out on bail. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
