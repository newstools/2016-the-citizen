The Democratic Alliance (DA) has called on the Standing Committee on Appropriations to deal with a total of R1.29 billion of &#8220;wasteful expenditure&#8221;. Part of this R1.29 billion was spent on ministerial cars that cost enough money to build citizens about 130 RDP houses. These are the ministers who have benefited from the expenditure: Two new Toyota Fortuners, valued at R623 788 and R625 718, respectively, were bought for Minister of Trade and Industry Rob Davies. Minister of Arts and Culture Nathi Mthethwa opted for two BMW 5 Series Sedans valued at R740 299 and R742 425, respectively Minister of Communications Faith Mthambi also went for a BMW X5 valued at R1.065 million Minister of Public Service and Administration Ngoako Ramatlhodi got a new Ford Everest valued at R714 500 Buti Manamela, deputy minister in the presidency for planning, monitoring and evaluation, only went an Audi Q7 3.0 TDI Quatrro, while deputy minister of public service and administration Ayanda Dlodlo got a new Audi A8 and Audi A7 valued at R750 000 and R735 000 respectively. The expenditure includes an administrative transfer of R200 000 from the department of trade and industry to an organisation called Progressive Youth in Business, which the DA said looked &#8220;suspiciously like an ANC-front organisation&#8221;. The said organisation is allegedly hosted by ANC treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize in his office at Luthuli House. This comes after City of Johannesburg Executive Mayor Herman Mashaba revealed in September that the ANC in the region had spent R190 million on travel over a period of three years. In the past financial year alone, R73 million was spent on travel by the previous administration. This misuse of public money is deplorable and must be condemned in the strongest terms. This could only have happened in an environment where travel opportunities were handed out to too many people, groups indulged in excessive luxury, and they had no regard for the value of travel to the residents of the city, said Mashaba. Following the report, Mashaba said he had requested that he directly approve all international travel by any representative of the City. The mayor said he would also review the size of the delegation, as the more people were sent, the more money would be spent on them.
