Radio host and choreographer Somizi Mhlongo has borrowed R400 from his colleague, Khanyi Mbau, and he refuses to pay it back. In a hilarious video posted by Mbau&#8217;s boyfriend, Tebogo Lerole, the two can be seen bickering over the R400 Mbau says he borrowed from her when they started working together at Metro FM. According to Mbau, the money, which Somizi said was R200 instead of the R400, was given to Somizi after he claimed to have left his wallet at home. Somizi, who jokingly called Mbau a &#8220;dog&#8221;, said he would never borrow money from her, as she was making noise about it. In fact, he reminded her of the things he had paid for her, meaning he did not owe anything anymore. He claimed to have paid for her breakfast, which cost R120, but he had offered to pay, Mbau retorted. The conclusion to the confrontation was that they would not pay anything for each other because, clearly, they would keep reminding each other of their past sins.
