In the back of the mind of every patriotic soccer follower in this country is that Mamelodi Sundowns have a chance few club sides can even dream about after a lightning strike of destiny lit up the Tshwane side s year. The Brazilians run out in Osaka tomorrow against Japanese J-League champions, Kashima Antlers, with the lure of a meeting with Colombian outfit, Atletico Nacional, in the following round. As Africa s representatives, much depends on Sundowns, whose fabled shot at the Caf Champions League title only happened by freak chance when AS Vita from the DRC were kicked out and the South African club were given a lifeline back into the knockout stages. They duly won by beating Egyptian giants Zamalek 3-1 in the home and away final. For the Downs players, simply being included among the elite clubs is a dream. Getting through to a semifinal and facing the possibility of trading skills with the fabled Real Madrid, goes beyond that. To their credit, this is the stated aim of the South Africans. It is a noble mission. But first comes the reality of getting past Antlers, a side with eight J-League championships engraved on their record books that has also claimed six J-League and four Emperors cups. Without dampening the excitement and enthusiasm within the South African club for having reached Japan in the first place, the local side present a formidable obstacle to progressing further. Downs coach Pitso Mosimane has told his side to go out and have fun , a signal call for them to relax, ignore the nerves and take the field secure in letting their combined skills take over with so much riding on a favourable result. As all South Africans undoubtedly believe, Sundowns have what it takes to progress. But win or lose the Brazilians have already made us proud.
