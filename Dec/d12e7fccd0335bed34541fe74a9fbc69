It is believed that a gang of thieves is targeting bars and restaurants in Port Elizabeth (PE), in the Eastern Cape, as another video has emerged of three men robbing a bar in the coastal city. The footage comes just about a week after three suspects were caught on CCTV camera stealing booze from the bar of a beachside cafe in Nelson Mandela Bay. In that footage, the suspects&#8217; faces could be identified, despite one of the suspects wearing gloves, presumably to hide his fingerprints. The HeraldLive reports that in the early hours of Thursday morning, three suspects were caught on CCTV footage smashing the sliding door of another PE bar and stealing a plasma television in 24 seconds. It was further reported that police spokesperson Colonel Priscilla Naidu said the staff had locked up 15 minutes before the robbery took place, and HeraldLive reported that the incident was similar to the robbery at the beachside bar reported on last week.
