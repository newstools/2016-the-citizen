Allister Coetzee will only know if he&#8217;ll remain Springbok coach at end of January. The South African Rugby Union (Saru) on Tuesday confirmed the embattled mentor&#8217;s performance review was conducted by the organisation&#8217;s high-performance committee. But stakeholders and fans hoping for a quick fix after a &#8220;profoundly disappointing season&#8221;, in which the Boks only won four of their 12 Tests, will be left frustrated.

Coetzee&#8217;s review wasn&#8217;t limited to his own insights. Three senior players &#8211; retiring captain Adriaan Strauss, Beast Mtawarira and Pat Lambie &#8211; all provided feedback from the players&#8217; perspective. &#8220;We review the Springbok season with the national coach at the end of each year, but this year s process has been given extra attention because of profoundly disappointing results,&#8221; said Alexander. &#8220;This was not a witch-hunt but a proper process to interrogate where things went wrong, with a focus on finding answers and ensuring it does not happen again.&#8221; Saru hopes to explore all avenues before it judges Coetzee and therefore wants to use the whole of next month for introspection. &#8220;We will act upon whatever interventions are identified as being necessary by all involved. I would expect that process to be completed before the end of January, said Alexander. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
