The CEO of Hattech, Pieter Hattingh, says he&#8217;s &#8220;an idiot&#8221; for referring to black people using the F-word and the k-word. While reacting to a farm murder case he claimed happened, Hattingh referred to the alleged attackers as: &#8220;Voken K***ers!!!!!&#8221;. Hattingh has since been forced to resign as head of the company, which describes itself as a surveillance firm. He told News24 that it was &#8220;stupid of me&#8221; to use such a word and that &#8220;I am not a racist&#8221;. His brother, Louis Hattingh, also confirmed to News24 that the company&#8217;s CEO resigned on Tuesday morning. Within minutes of him posting the comment, Hattingh&#8217;s Facebook friends were advising him to remove it in case &#8220;the wrong person&#8221; saw it and he &#8220;got into trouble&#8221;. Another said he was in &#8220;dangerous terrain &#8230; and you know what I mean.&#8221; Another, though, supporting the post, wrote: &#8220;Facts are facts, the barbarians are definitely not human!&#8221; For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
