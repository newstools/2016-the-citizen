The inhuman siege which has held the ancient metropolis of Aleppo, once the third biggest city in the Ottoman Empire, in thrall for nearly four years, is a tragedy few of us removed by half the globe from Syria can even begin to imagine. The cynical cast-iron jaws of political expedience and indifference has locked the city in a human tragedy almost beyond comprehension, allowing the deaths of countless thousands of non-combatants, and turning what was once titled the Islamic Capital of Culture 2006 into a wasteland of once proud medieval architecture and heritage. Truce after truce has been proposed, but none have held as drones and warplanes continue to ravage an already ruined community whose unwilling citizens have been held captive by man s blind indifference to his fellow man. Aleppo may not have the resonance for the Western consciousness that the slaying of 12 cartoonists at the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo engendered, or a lorry deliberately aimed at killing Christmas shoppers in Germany. But, despite that, we must remember Aleppo and be aware that ordinary people are still living there. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
