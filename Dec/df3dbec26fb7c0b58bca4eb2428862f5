Mining production contracted at a rate of 2.9% year-on-year in October compared to a rise of 4.7% year-on-year in September, Statistics South Africa said on Thursday. The main negative contributors to the decline were platinum group metals, manganese ore, gold, and other nonmetallic minerals. Revealing mining production statistics for the year to October, StatsSA said mining production was down 5.2% year-on-year compared to an increase of 4.3% year-on-year in 2015. StatsSA said the contraction in mining production reflected the effects of suppressed international commodity prices that had been amplified by various domestic challenges. These pertain to above inflation utility cost increases and wage settlements; infrastructure constraints and perceived policy uncertainty, StatsSA said. The Chamber of Mines has noted that finalisation of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act (MPRDA) Amendment Bill and the contested Mining Charter are imperatives for the industry.
