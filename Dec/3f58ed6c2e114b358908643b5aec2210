A constable attached to Skukuza police shot and killed his partner and a contractor in two separate incidents in the Kruger National Parks (KNP) on Friday, said Mr William Mabasa, acting head of communications, SANParks in a press release, reports the Lowvelder. According to Captain Fakude from Acornhoek police, at about 2.25pm a police constable stationed at Skukuza police allegedly shot and killed a 38-year-old man, known to be from Malawi, at Skukuza Workshop. The victim was on duty at the workshop when the suspect arrived in his Grey Mercedes Benz C Class, parked and shot him five times on the upper body. The suspect left the victim&#8217;s lifeless body and drove away. He then went to the staff village. When he stopped his vehicle next to the door of his house, his wife ran out of the house crying. She threw her handbag to her neighbour who was outside and the suspect gave chase. About 39 metres from the house, he shot her three times on her upper body. She died on the scene. He went into the house, left the 9mm weapon on the bed and exited the house again. The neighbour went inside and hid the weapon. The suspect went back into the house after a while, and locked himself inside. Captain Leon Davel from Vereeniging K9 Unit, who was on duty with Rhino 6, went to the scene and requested the suspect to open the door. He refused. Davel broke the door down and arrested him at 2.50pm. The neighbour handed the firearm to the captain. The suspect was charged with double murder. Three empty cartridges were found next to the second victim. The suspect alleged that his wife (the deceased) had an extra-marital affair with the first victim. The first scene was about 800 metres from the second scene. The second victim was legally married to the suspect. Members of Skukuza police are currently investigating the incidents.
