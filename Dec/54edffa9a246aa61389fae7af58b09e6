A 36-year-old woman handed herself over to police at the weekend after stabbing her boyfriend to death in Marabastad, Pretoria. Pretoria Central police spokesperson Captain Augustinah Selepe confirmed the incident, Rekord East reported. &#8220;The cause of the stabbing was unknown and would form part of a police investigation.&#8221; Selepe said 23 other people were arrested at the weekend for defeating the ends of justice. We arrested four illegal immigrants, one person for being in possession of suspected stolen property, seven for theft, two for dealing in counterfeit property, five for drinking in public, two for driving under the influence of alcohol, one for armed robbery and one for murder, she said. Selepe said all those arrested would be appearing in the Pretoria Magistrates&#8217; Court this week. She said police visibility would increase during the festive season in an effort to tackle crime. Our men and women in blue are always expected to be able to deal compassionately with people who either could be perpetrators, victims, witnesses or suspects of crime, she said. As is always the case during the festive season, our police officers will work abnormal hours, responding to all types of crimes and volatile scenes. &#8211; Caxton News Service For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
