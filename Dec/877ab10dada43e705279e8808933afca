The ministers of agriculture in Namibia and South Africa met in Swaziland to discuss and clarify South Africa s import requirements with regards to TB testing. According to the department of agriculture, forestry and fisheries (Daff), South Africa has not suspended its import requirements for TB for cattle coming in for feedlotting or slaughter. The requirements remain that the cattle should show no sign of bovine tuberculosis on the day of shipment, originate from a herd free from bovine tuberculosis or were subjected to a tuberculin test for bovine tuberculosis with negative results during the 30 days prior to shipment; and are not being eliminated as part of an eradication programme against bovine tuberculosis. Namibia claims to be TB-free and had submitted surveillance information to the SA Veterinary Authorities which could not scientifically prove freedom from TB, Daff spokesperson Steve Galane said. If the certifying vets in Namibia are confident that the herds from which the animals originate are free of TB, then they will be able to certify that requirement.
