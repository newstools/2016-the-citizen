There was no indication that ill health would lead to Sfiso Ncwane&#8217;s passing this weekend. The sturdy 37-year old gospel star had carried on with his usual business, which saw him perform around the country and retire home to spend time with his wife and two sons. Last week Friday, Sfiso was in good spirits as he was accompanied by his driver and pianist, Siphamandla Vezi, to look for paving tiles for his Fourways, Johannesburg, home. Vezi was close to Ncwane and had worked with him since 2014. According to The Sowetan, Vezi was also with Ncwane when he had to perform in Polokwane. They drove there together and back.

It was then that Ncwane began feeling sick. &#8220;When we got there, he started to complain about being tired. Honestly, I never thought it would be the last time. When his wife called to say he had passed on, I went to the hospital. I found him lying there with a smile on his face,&#8221; said Vezi. Ayanda, who has been married for nine years to Sfiso, was there during his last moments at Fourways Life hospital. He was admitted at 9.30am on Monday morning and passed on shortly thereafter.
