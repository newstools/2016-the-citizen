by Kieran CANNING Real fly out to Japan on Sunday aiming to be crowned the world&#8217;s best team for a fifth time on the back of a club record 35-game unbeaten run in all competitions. However, a much-changed Real side had to rely on Ramos to bail them out late on once more on Saturday. Just a week after netting a last minute equaliser against Barcelona, Ramos powered home the winner as Real overcame a 2-1 deficit in the final six minutes. &#8220;In the end we won the game and that is the way we go into a competition like the Club World Cup,&#8221; said the Spanish international. Real coach Zinedine Zidane left Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Luka Modric out of his squad completely as he rested the majority of his first-choice XI. That decision nearly backfired as Joselu struck twice in two minutes for Deportivo just after the hour mark to cancel out Alvaro Morata&#8217;s opener. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t a great performance. We made mistakes which were costly, but at the end we managed to turn it around,&#8221; added Ramos. However, Zidane claimed those that came into the side had done themselves proud as substitute Mariano Diaz took advantage of a rare first-team chance to head home Lucas Vazquez&#8217;s cross and set up a grandstand finish. &#8220;I am happy for all the players because they played great,&#8221; said Zidane. &#8220;The game became complicated when we made a mistake for the first goal. &#8220;You have to congratulate the opponents, they played very well and made it very difficult for us. &#8220;But, in the end, we got the three points at that is the most important thing.&#8221; The late fightback ensured Zidane&#8217;s men have now surpassed Real&#8217;s previous record mark of 34 games unbeaten from the 1988/89 season under Dutch coach Leo Beenhakker. And the Frenchman hailed his side&#8217;s mental strength, led by the inspirational captaincy of Ramos. &#8220;Mentally it helps to have gone 35 games unbeaten. It gives you strength,&#8221; added Zidane. &#8220;Sergio is special because it is not the first time. He is our captain and with many others he is the soul of this team.&#8221; However, Deportivo coach Gaizka Garitano raged that Real had been the beneficiaries of favourable refereeing. &#8220;They have a lot of potential, but when you see five minutes added on in a game when there has been no time lost, we knew it would be played until they score,&#8221; said Garitano.
