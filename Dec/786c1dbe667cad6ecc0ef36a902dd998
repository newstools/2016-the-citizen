By listing such sites, UNESCO is seeking to mobilise the international community to protect them. During its 40th session in July, 2016, in Istanbul, UNESCO s World Heritage Committee added sites in Mali and Uzbekistan to the list, along with Libya s five world heritage sites which have already been damaged by conflict in the North African country. &#8211; International protection &#8211; ============================ Conflict, earthquakes and other natural disasters, pollution, poaching, uncontrolled urbanisation and unchecked tourism development pose major problems to world heritage sites, UNESCO says. It lists two categories of dangers: either ascertained &#8212; specific and proven imminent threats &#8212; or potential , when property faces threats which could negatively affect its world heritage value. Adding a site to the list allows the allocation of immediate World Heritage Fund assistance to the endangered property. It also alerts the international community to these situations in the hope that it will join efforts to save the endangered sites, and allows conservation specialists to respond efficiently to specific needs. &#8211; Some endangered sites &#8211; ========================= &#8211; Afghanistan: archaeological remains of Jam (2002) and the Bamiyan Valley (2003). &#8211; Iraq: Ashur (2003), Hatra (2015) and Samarra Archaeological City (2007). &#8211; Jerusalem: Old City and its walls (1982). &#8211; Mali: Tomb of Askia (2012), Timbuktu (2012), Old Towns of Djenne (2016). &#8211; Niger: Air and Tenere natural reserves (1992). &#8211; Syria: Ancient cities of Aleppo (2013), Bosra (2013) and Damascus (2013), ancient villages of northern Syria (2013), Crac des Chevaliers and Qal&#8217;at Salah El-Din (2013), Palmyra (2013). &#8211; Yemen: Historic town of Zabid (2000), old city of Sanaa (2015), old walled city of Shibam (2015).
