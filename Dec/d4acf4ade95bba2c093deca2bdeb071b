The Blitzboks were hardly tested on Saturday as they cantered to an easy win over Russia by 41-0 in their first pool game of the Cape Town Sevens. Neil Powell&#8217;s men extended their winning streak over their opponents to 18 matches as their skills and organisation was simply too good. Seabelo Senatla &#8211; in his last Sevens tournament before taking up the 15-man game full-time with the Stormers &#8211; was in typically rampant form as he rounded off his two tries in the opposite corners. He might be known as a finisher but he certainly showed his work ethic in roaming around on the field instead of just staying in one position. It was also heartening to see how South Africa were willing to be patient. They didn&#8217;t merely rock up and try to play the limited Russians off the park immediately. When the Blitzboks&#8217; opponents tackled well, they kept a cool head. Even when replacement Vladislav Lazarenko poached a poor kick-off and seemed destined for the try-line, the hosts didn&#8217;t allow him to canter through. Instead, Justin Geduld flattened him with a brilliant tackle over the touchline. As was expected, the Russians unraveled in the latter stages and the South Africans enjoyed themselves. They next play the USA at 16:07. Point-scorers: Blitzboks (17) &#8211; Tries: Seabelo Senatla (2), Werner Kok (2), Philip Snyman, Dylan Sage, Justin Geduld.
