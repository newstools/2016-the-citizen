Given that he scored an astonishing 34 357 runs in his international career, Sachin Tendulkar truly must&#8217;ve felt invincible at times. But there was one bowler he apparently never really felt comfortable against: the late Proteas captain, Hansie Cronje. According to the Hindustan Times, where the legendary Indian batsman spoke at the publication&#8217;s leadership summit, he was asked about the toughest bowler he faced and &#8220;without hesitation&#8221; gave the unexpected answer. &#8220;People don t believe me, but yes, there have been times when I was well set and Hansie came on to bowl and I would be extra vigilant,&#8221; said Tendulkar. &#8220;&#8221;I told my partner, I will play off Allan Donald or Shaun Pollock, you please deal with Hansie for me. He has got me out so many times and on multiple occasions.&#8221; Cronje, who was a useful seamer, dismissed the diminutive stroke-maker five times in 11 Tests. Tendulkar made numerous other provocative statements at the event, such as suggesting domestic cricket matches in India should be played on two different pitches to expose the players to different conditions.
