Records tumbled at Newlands last night as the Proteas beat the Springboks by 16 runs in the third edition of the Nelson Mandela Legacy Cup. The Boks, who unfortunately have made a habit in 2016 of conceding big scores, did so on the cricket field as well allowing the Proteas to amass 252/9 in their 20 overs. At least they launched a valiant effort to overhaul an improbable target. Hashim Amla was the mainstay of the Proteas innings. After initially playing quite sedately, the bearded veteran exploded into life, hitting six sixes in a superb 90 off merely 42 deliveries. Amla struggled for support as the national cricket side tended to lose wickets at inopportune times against a varied attack before Dwaine Pretorius took the game away from the Boks. 47 runs flowed off his blade from just 14 balls as the Proteas got out of sight. If this game had been official, it would ve been the fifth highest T20 total of all time. The Boks looked dead and buried after slipping to 92/5 in the 11th over but they feasted on the Protea attack in the latter stages of the chase. Damian de Allende, a competent cricketer at school, showed his dormant cricketing ability with an aggressive 60. The Bok midfielder particularly relished hitting on the leg side and celebrated his fifty joyfully. Faf de Klerk, the diminutive Lions scrumhalf, also impressed at the top of the order with a compact innings of 32. It was a lovely night. We really enjoy spending time with the Boks, said Faf du Plessis, the Proteas captain, afterwards. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
