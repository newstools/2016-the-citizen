Actor and model Pearl Thusi has found herself on the wrong side of the Twitterverse after responding to Boitumelo Thulo&#8217;s question on monogamy. Taking to Twitter recently, Boity asked what if monogamy was unnatural, a question that grabbed Thusi&#8217;s attention. &#8220;Then Aids will also be a natural part of life,&#8221; she responded, a comment that left Boity&#8217;s followers unimpressed. &#8220;You went to America, and suddenly acquired their ignorance,&#8221; said one follower.
