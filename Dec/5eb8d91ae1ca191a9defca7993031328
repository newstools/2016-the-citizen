Papa Penny Penny, real name Eric Nkovani, has once again addressed reports that he had admitted to being Cassper Nyovest&#8217;s father, saying they were false, in a recent interview with DJ Sbu. According to Penny Penny, the rumours came after a picture Cassper took with him before he became a big star but only posted on Facebook when he became famous. &#8220;I think that rumour went on for more than two years, and they said, he looks like you,&#8221; he told Sbu, who said they did look alike and that their only difference was the hairstyle, as Cassper had a ponytail. The rumours turned into stories that Penny Penny said he initially didn&#8217;t take seriously, as he thought people were just joking around. &#8220;And then people started making stories on Facebook &#8216;DNA said I&#8217;m his biological father&#8217;. But, you know, I always said, ah they are just joking; they are just joking like that.&#8221; This is when Drum Magazine picked up the story and requested an interview with Penny Penny, though they told him they wanted to discuss Clash Of The Choirs, a show he was part of at the time. &#8220;And then one day, the time of the Clash Of The Choirs, they [Drum Magazine] asked to come and do an interview about Clash Of The Choirs at my home. Then we did the interview, and after its release, I see &#8216;Penny Penny says Cassper is my son&#8217;. &#8220;And we were recording, I don&#8217;t do telephonic interviews. I need to record, and we sign what I&#8217;ve said.&#8221; After reading the headline, he said he was shocked. &#8220;Me, I never said that. Then I said: &#8216;Bring the tape,&#8217; but Drum Magazine never brought the tape.&#8221; &#8220;And then I saw that I was getting sued, and when I was surprised, they put me and Cassper when they never put me and the mother.&#8221; The magazine has since reached a settlement with Cassper&#8217;s mother after she sued them for the story, though Penny Penny said they had not done the same with him. &#8220;It was very painful to lie on me. It was like I was buying the son because Cassper is a star. I cannot buy a child; I make children.&#8221; He said the story made it look like he wanted to use the Mama I Made It hitmaker to make a comeback to TV screens, something he said he did not need, as he was also a star. Penny Penny has a wife and 18 children. &nbsp;
