2016 has &#8220;by far&#8221; been the worst year of Bryan Habana&#8217;s career. In a candid post on Instagram, the Springbok winger implores South African rugby to engage with all its stakeholders to halt a slide that has seen the national side plumb new depths. &#8220;To even begin to dissect where it&#8217;s all gone wrong is immensely difficult,&#8221; Habana wrote. &#8220;There are just too many things across the board to dissect. You can&#8217;t put it down to just one thing.&#8221; Last weekend&#8217;s 13-27 reverse against Wales in Cardiff meant the Springboks ended their international season with a pitiful 33% win percentage 4 victories from 12 starts. Naturally, much of the blame has been laid at coach Allister Coetzee&#8217;s door, whose confusing selection policies and tactical ineptness has been highlighted as factors that contributed to the Springboks&#8217; decline. Yet Habana believes the players should also be held accountable. &#8220;Our on-field performances, bar a few at certain times, haven&#8217;t been up to standard, and we take full responsibility for that,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;I fully understand the hurt, dissatisfaction and despair of the fans about where this side is.&#8221; Despite adding three more tries to his Springbok tally, the 33-year-old veteran accepts his own form has waned. &#8220;I honestly felt I could&#8217;ve made a positive impact in 2016, and I apologise for the part I&#8217;ve played in the results this year. &#8220;I believe open and honest discussions are needed between administrators, players, coaches and politicians to start a proper process of rebuilding.&#8221; &nbsp;
