According to a report in the Sunday Times, FNB has become the first of the big South African banks to reveal why they closed bank accounts associated with the controversial Gupta family. FirstRand CEO Johan Burger said there were suspicions that the accounts were being used to launder money. The revelation appears in an affidavit filed to the High Court in Pretoria in response to Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan&#8217;s application for the court to declare that government has no powers to intervene in the banking decision to terminate business relationships with the Guptas, which was also taken by Absa, Nedbank and Standard Bank. Presumably, the other banks would have had a similar reason for refusing to deal with the family. Gordhan&#8217;s application in October named 72 &#8220;dubious&#8221; transactions totalling R6.8 billion. The Guptas&#8217; attorney, Gert van der Merwe, told the paper that the banks were supporting Gordhan&#8217;s application because that would allow them to escape an inquiry. He disputed that the banks had any solid evidence of malfeasance and claimed it was all just &#8220;boring innuendo&#8221;. &#8220;What is funny for me is the fact that they don&#8217;t come forward with reasons [for account closures]. To continue with the innuendo is becoming a little boring for me.&#8221; For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
