Two white men, accused of assaulting a black man and forcing him into a coffin, are expected to apply for bail in the Middelburg Magistrate s Court in Mpumalanga on Thursday. Theo Martins Jackson and Willem Oostuizen allegedly beat up Victor Rethabile Mlotshwa, whom they accused of trespassing, before forcing him into a coffin while threatening to set him alight. A video of the assault went viral on social media leading to a national outcry. At their last court appearance on December 2, a scuffle broke out outside the court about 20 minutes after the court had adjourned for lunch. An unknown man was severely beaten by a mob. The man fell to the ground and was trampled on. A road signboard was put on him while he lay on the ground. The man got up and staggered through the crowd with his T-shirt pulled up to cover his face. He had sustained a wound at the back of the head. Police saved him from further attack. The court has been warned against granting the pair bail because of the anger in the community.
