Deputy president of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Floyd Shivambu has come out to reassure party supporters that there&#8217;s no fight between him and EFF leader Julius Malema on Monday. This after former EFF Gauteng leader Lufuno Gogoro suggested that Shivambu and Malema are not in good terms. Gogoro wrote on Facebook that &#8220;I find out that it&#8217;s true that Floyd has ambition to lead the EFF and that they are fighting with Julius.&#8221; Gogoro further alleged that &#8220;it is said Julius has been complaining that he&#8217;s surrounded by people who do [not] love him and who want him dead. Am not sure how true is this but it is said that there is no more peace in Braamfontein Headquarters of the EFF.&#8221; The Citizen contacted Gogoro to find out if he really meant everything he wrote on Facebook, and he reiterated what he said. After being contacted by this website for comment, EFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi only said that Gogoro is no longer a news source and is only peddling rumours. Also read: Shivambu planning to remove Malema , alleges ex-member Shivambu has also since responded, saying there&#8217;s unity in the EFF and that the party will never be divided. He also slated The Citizen for publishing &#8220;bullsh*t and nonsense&#8221;. &#8220;The Citizen newspaper specializes in writing bullsh*t and nonsense about the EFF. I thought it had ended after the expulsion of that guy.&#8221; He was clearly referring to the recent dismissal of former editor Steven Motale from the publication. &#8220;The EFF will never be divided. Fools and Staff Riders tried but they all collapsed and we are still solid. It will never change.&#8221;
