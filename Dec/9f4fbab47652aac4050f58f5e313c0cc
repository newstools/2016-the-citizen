Olympic gold medallist Caster Semenya may have started a trend without even realising it. This after presenter and model Bonang Matheba followed in her footsteps and slammed negative comments from haters. Bonang&#8217;s follower took to Twitter to raise their concern over Matheba not having time to present The Front Row, her show on Metro SA, saying it was the reason people have been calling for the media industry to give a chance to new talent. &#8220;So @bonang_m is too busy for @METROFMSA? And you wonder why people ask you to open up industry, and why they chose stations with consistency,&#8221; said Sakhile Magalela. Bonang was having none of the negativity, she told the fan to &#8220;Tsek!&#8221; http://twitter.com/bonang_m/status/804599379483041792 &#8220;In the words of the great Caster Semenya- TSEK!&#8221; While some found Bonang&#8217;s response funny, some agreed with the follower, saying they were raising a &#8220;serious&#8221; concern. &#8220;This is true though&#8230; They should just give other kids a chance,&#8221; said one of her followers, while another said: &#8220;Don&#8217;t swear at this guy, dats true and that&#8217;s why Metro FM always losing listeners each and everyday. leya bora hle.&#8221; Also read: WATCH: Tsek! Caster tells haters on live TV Some of her fans were, however, left wondering if her boyfriend, Kiernan &#8216;AKA&#8217; Forbes had been tweeting on her behalf. Their argument was that the model had never responded to negativity. http://twitter.com/bonang_m/status/805394799121629184 On Sunday she posted a number of tweets, some of her pictures and some, complaining about a flight that had been cancelled. She went on to tweet &#8220;Uyany*sa. In all aspects&#8221;, further raising questions as to whether her boyfriend really was tweeting for her. If Bonang tweeted these herself, we do not know what she&#8217;ll be saying next year. Perhaps, being one of the celebs who receive the most negative comments, the model is just tired and has adopted new way of dealing with it.
