Two church pastors have been arrested for rape one in Cape Town and the other in Butterworth in the Eastern Cape, police said on Saturday. A 32-year-old pastor was arrested in Cape Town for the alleged rape of a 16-year-old congregation member, Western Cape police spokesman Captain FC van Wyk said. The victim was allegedly taken to the pastor s residence under the pretence of praying for her on Wednesday morning. While instructing the victim to undress to apply oil to her body, the pastor [allegedly] pushed her unto his bed and raped her. The victim reported the matter to the South African Police Service (SAPS) and the suspect was arrested, Van Wyk said. The pastor is expected to appear in court soon. In the second case, a 43-year-old Zion Christian Church (ZCC) pastor was arrested for rape on Friday afternoon, Eastern Cape SAPS spokesman Captain Jackson Manatha said. It is alleged that the suspect took an 18-year-old woman to wash her under the bridge on Wednesday 7 December as she was ill. The suspect was with the victim only and after washing her with traditional medicine, he allegedly touched her private parts. It is alleged that the pastor drove with the victim back to her home. On the same date at about 4.30pm he fetched the victim and drove with her to a certain shack at Ibika township, Butterworth, where she was told to take off her clothes. The pastor also took off his clothes. The victim was instructed to lie on the bed. She was then allegedly raped by the suspect. The pastor later drove the victim to her home, where she told her sister about the rape. A case of rape was registered at Msobomvu police station and the pastor was charged. He would appear in the Butterworth Magistrate s Court on Monday, Manatha said.
