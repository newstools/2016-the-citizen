It s been 40 days since loved ones last saw any trace of Madelein Murray, reports the Pretoria Moot Rekord. Murray was in the car with her son on November 11 when she tried to cross the low-lying bridge over the Apies River in Flowers Street, Capital Park, when they were swept away by floods. Murray s son, Henco, 21, was found alive, one kilometre away, but the search for her was officially called off on November 19. A memorial service for Murray led by Pastor Bert Murray was held on December 11. Volunteers, police, the fire department, AfriForum and the CPF expanded their search as far as the Bon Accord Dam. Murray s sister-in-law, Heila du Plessis, said: We have searched the whole Apies River at least three times. We have searched from the bridge all the way to the Bon Accord dam. There is simply no trace of her. Murray s family asked anyone with any information to call 083 324 9595 or 076 748 0112.
