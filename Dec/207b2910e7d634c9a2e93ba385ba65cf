By now, most soccer fans are aware of the Chinese soccer revolution as their top teams swing huge offers in front of top players&#8217; noses. Oscar, the 25-year-old Chelsea playmaker, last week signed a massive deal of 60 million euros with Shanghai and is the latest mainstream player to follow the cash. Now, according to the Daily Mirror, Chinese soccer administrators have moved to recruit England&#8217;s top referee, Mark Clattenburg. The 41-year-old on Tuesday was named the best referee at the annual Globe Soccer Awards in Dubai. Chinese soccer has been hampered recently by various match fixing scandals and believe they might improve the integrity of their Super League by tempting Clattenburg. Crazy amounts of money are being thrown to numerous top players and some European-based managers have already expressed concern over the potential monetary strength of Chinese football. But targeting referees is a rather intriguing new trend. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
