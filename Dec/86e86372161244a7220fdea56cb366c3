Domestic cricket&#8217;s semi-pro competition is pretty much played in the shadows but sometimes it delivers some interesting feats. On Saturday, in a three-day match between Western Province and North West at Newlands, the Malan brothers dominated the game in a unique manner. All three &#8211; Pieter (27), Andre (25) and Janneman (20) &#8211; scored centuries on the same day as North West eventually won a thrilling contest after they needed a steep 351 in 74 overs. They reached that target with one ball to spare.

The eldest of the trio is perhaps the most celebrated player in the family having been a key member of the South Africa Under-19 side that was led in 2007/08 by Wayne Parnell, although he under-performed during that season&#8217;s World Cup. Pieter did play franchise cricket for the Titans but his opportunities have become limited and has only now started to come back into the frame after moving to Western Province. Western Province declared with him on 117*. But sibling rivalry in this match was about to take off in a big way. &#8220;Baby brother&#8221; Janneman launched North West&#8217;s reply with a brilliant 135 off 158 deliveries, smacking 16 fours and two sixes in the process. The 21-year-old also played for the national Under-19 side, particularly impressing on the side&#8217;s tour to England. Janneman was solid in the &#8220;Test&#8221; matches but clearly enjoyed the one-day series more, where he scored four fifties in the five-match series. Numerous observers note he is perhaps the most exciting talent of the three brothers. Yet it was left to Andre to apply the finishing touches. He finished on an unbeaten 103 off 106 as North West celebrated a momentous victory. Andre had played in last season&#8217;s domestic T20 competition for the Highveld Lions and all three brothers remain on the fringes of selection for their franchises.
