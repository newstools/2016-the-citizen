Over 20 church goers were treated by paramedics on Thursday, after they were allegedly given a &#8220;liquid substance&#8221; by a pastor at a church service at the Mthatha City Hall, the Eastern Cape health department said. Eastern Cape Health spokesperson, Sizwe Kupelo confirmed the incident and said that emergency services were called to the scene at a church service gone wrong on Thursday afternoon. It is alleged that the congregants were given a liquid substance by their pastor when they suddenly vomited and collapsed, said Kupelo. Kupelo said over 20 people were treated by paramedics at the scene but they refused to be taken to hospital. Only one agreed to be ferried to Nelson Mandela Academic hospital, he said. Police spokesperson, Colonel Mzukisi Fatyela told African News Agency (ANA) that two people were in a critical condition at the Mthatha hospital. Fatyela said that a criminal case had not been opened. This does not mean a case won t be opened, we are communicating with the doctors and they still need to determine if this substance was poisonous or not, said Fatyela. At this stage the type of liquid ingested by the group of congregants is unknown. Kupelo said the pastor was identified as Prophet Pumzile Topi, and he reportedly fled the scene. -African News Agency For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
