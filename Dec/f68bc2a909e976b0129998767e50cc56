And the casino industry s biggest winner for the 2016-2017 tax year is (drum roll) &#8230; the taxman! The 11th annual survey from the Casino Association of South Africa (Casa), which was released on Wednesday, found that the South African Receiver of Revenue scooped up 36% of gross gambling revenues during the period under review. That amounted to a total jackpot of R5.9 billion, paid through various taxes and levies across local, provincial and national governments by the association s 36 members. Casa, which represents the interests of all but two of the 38 legal, land-based casinos in the country, noted that this, in turn, leads to improved infrastructure, education and healthcare funding . Releasing the survey, Casa s chief executive, advocate Themba Ngobese, said gross gambling revenues, which totalled R18.2 billion, were up 6.7% on the previous year. The association said in a statement the survey showed that despite tough economic conditions, the licensed casino industry remained an important driver of the South African economy. It made a significant contribution to employment, social responsibility and infrastructure development. Casa said that the 64 000 employees supported by Casa member casinos and their related activities, such as hotels, conference centres, restaurants and theatres, were a big beneficiary of the industry s continued growth. It added that casino employees received 20% of the value generated by Casa member casinos during the year, amounting to R3.4 billion. The statement said: Once again Casa members increased their corporate social investment spend, contributing more than R165 million (up by 9.4% from last year) to education, skills development, sports development, community upliftment and healthcare.
