Another Laudium robbery in Pretoria has left one man dead when he and an accomplice allegedly attacked a family. On Sunday night, the robber was shot dead and another arrested when a shootout ensued between the intruders and security officials. The shooting happened when the robbers allegedly entered a house, police spokesperson Constable Tumisang Moloto said. They found family members and threatened them with a firearm, demanding cash and jewellery. The alarm system was activated, and local security officials responded, he said. Upon arrival, the security officials confronted the robbers, who then opened fire. The officials also returned fire, Moloto said. One suspect was fatally wounded and another one was arrested by the police. An unlicensed firearm, jewellery and undisclosed amount of cash were confiscated. This was one of many robberies and attacks that have ended with a fatality in the area in the past few months. In October, a robber was killed when community members caught him and beat him to death. A few weeks prior, a 40-year-old father was shot dead in front of his family when armed men entered his home in Erasmia. &#8211; rorisangk@citizen.co.za
