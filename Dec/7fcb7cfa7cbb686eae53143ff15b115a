A fugitive who has been hiding for the past three years in Eersterust, east of Pretoria, has been arrested. The man, 32, was detained after an altercation with his girlfriend. She complained to police she was scared of him as he has previously been arrested. Eersterust police spokesperson Sergeant Sam Shibambo said preliminary investigation revealed that the suspect was wanted for a fraud case, as well as for escaping from lawful custody in Nelspruit, Mpumalanga.

He added that four other people were arrested for drug-related crimes, three for possession of drugs and one for cultivation of dagga, in the same area. Eersterust resident Raylene Magardie was delighted when one of her neighbours was arrested for possession of drugs. And so my prayers were answered. Thank you Lord &#8230; he was caught red-handed with the full package of cat, she posted on Facebook. A couple of weeks before the arrest, Magardie and her neighbours stopped more than 10 men from buying drugs in Westminster Street, where they live. No one was able to enter the yard where he (the drug dealer) stays. No car was able to stop there, Magardie said. Concerned Parents Association chairperson Desiree Fisher said they welcomed the drug-related arrests. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
