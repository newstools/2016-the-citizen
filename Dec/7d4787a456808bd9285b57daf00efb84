President Jacob Zuma reportedly used an expensive chartered plane to attend the memorial service of late Cuban leader Fidel Castro, despite his presidential jet being fully functional. This is according to Democratic Alliance MP Kobus Marais, who said that records showed that Zuma flew to Cuba on Tuesday in a Gulfstream 550, which was reportedly chartered from an Angolan company, Bestfly, while Inkwazi appeared to still be intact, having only taken six flights during November. According to TimesLive, the same company was used to fly Zuma to the G20 Summit that was hosted in China in September.

Marais alleged that the chartering of a plane from Bestfly contravened government directives, which specified that private aircraft should be chartered from companies authorised to provide services to government until March 2017. Additionally, the crew on the plane needed to be cleared by SA National Defence Force (SANDF) Intelligence and should preferably consist of South African citizens. Marais said Zuma was costing taxpayers millions through the consistent and unnecessary use of chartered aircraft. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
