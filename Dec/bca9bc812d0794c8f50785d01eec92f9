AB de Villiers has solved the Proteas&#8217; thorny captaincy issue in Test matches by stepping down from his full-time role. The dynamic middle-order batter confirmed his decision on Monday evening after learning he won&#8217;t be fit in time for the Test series against Sri Lanka starting December 26. De Villiers had surgery on a troublesome elbow and hasn&#8217;t played competitive cricket since July. During that time, Faf du Plessis has played the captaincy role brilliantly, especially in last month&#8217;s momentous series win in Australia.

It was a fantastic honour for me to be asked to captain the Test side but I have missed two series and I am still in doubt for the upcoming series against Sri Lanka,&#8221; said De Villiers. &#8220;Following the squad s outstanding performances in Australia, it is clearly in the greater interests of the team that Faf du Plessis should be confirmed as the permanent Test captain. I have known Faf for almost 20 years, ever since we played in the same school side at Affies, and he will have my unequivocal support if he is asked to continue leading this exciting Proteas Test team. De Villiers and team management moved quickly to allay speculation that his decision might impact his future plans. Rumours swirled before last season&#8217;s series against England that he was contemplating international retirement &#8211; or at least ditching one format of the game &#8211; to prolong his career. But the Proteas&#8217; one-day skipper hopes to be ready for the white-ball series against the Islanders in January. &#8220;AB s left elbow is much improved but is still regaining the last few degrees of straightening. Fitness to play requires full range of elbow movement and this may take another three to four weeks to achieve,&#8221; said Mohammed Moosajee, the team manager and doctor. &#8220;He will be unavailable for the Test series against Sri Lanka and will target a return for the ODI series starting at the end of January.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
