AB de Villiers, the Proteas captain, is still in a race against time to be fit for the Test series against Sri Lanka. The dynamic batsman had hoped to feature in Sunday&#8217;s domestic T20 match between the Titans and Warriors but confirmed to SAcricketmag that an early comeback from elbow surgery was premature. &#8221; (Titans captain) Albie Morkel and (coach) Mark Boucher wanted me to play which boosted me to try and come back, but the surgeon said three months, not two months, so I ve been a bit naughty,&#8221; said De Villiers. &#8220;I ve tried to push it hard to get back on the park. Hopefully I ll make the Test matches but we ll see what happens in a week s time. We ll assess it as we go on but things change all the time.&#8221; The Test series against Sri Lanka starts in Port Elizabeth on December 26.
