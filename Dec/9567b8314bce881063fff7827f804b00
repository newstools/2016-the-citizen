The Gauteng traffic police said on Wednesday they were going to deploy officers at all exits of taxi ranks in the province. In a statement, Gauteng traffic police spokesperson Busaphi Nxumalo said they had a challenge where they found most minibus taxis travelling to neighbouring provinces were overloaded. Nxumalo said that overloaded taxis increased the risk of road accident fatalities. A vehicle or taxi that is found to be overloaded will be impounded with immediate effect, said Nxumalo. The Gauteng Traffic Police have embarked on the campaign to have roadworthy taxis under the slogan: Asibhenywa Asiwubambhi Umshini Siyabopha .
