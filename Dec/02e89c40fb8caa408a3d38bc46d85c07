Sri Lanka got their tour of South Africa off to a decent start on Sunday in Potchefstroom but, like most tours abroad too, they&#8217;ll wonder how competitive their opposition is. The tourists were hardly threatened by a South African Invitational XI, whose attack struggled to assert itself on a typically flat Senwes Park surface as they ended the first day on 328/6. Also read: There&#8217;s no sibling rivalry in the talented Malan family Four Sri Lankans made half-centuries, with the opening pair of Dimuth Karunaratne (71) and Kaushal Silva (80) both missing out on three figures because they decided to retire out. It&#8217;s a noble gesture, especially since it grants others time in the middle. But in a country where the Islanders&#8217; batters historically struggle, it might&#8217;ve been more valuable to compile bigger scores. Karunaratne and Silva added an effortless 159. The compact Kusal Mendis &#8211; the hero in this year&#8217;s home series against Australia &#8211; hit ten fours in his 64-ball 51 before his innings was cut short by the steady, promising Cobras all-rounder Jason Smith (1/26). Dhanajaya de Silva, unbeaten on 57 off 67, made the bowlers sweat in the latter stages of the day. Sri Lanka will hope though their captain, Angelo Mathews, scores some runs in the second innings after falling prey to left-arm spinner George Linde (2/72) for a duck. The dependable all-rounder hasn&#8217;t played competitive cricket since August and comes into this tour a bit &#8220;cold&#8221;. Smith&#8217;s seamers once again showed his potential to become a devastating batting all-rounder yet it was Knights quick Duanne Olivier that made a noticeable impression with the ball. The 24-year-old is to date the leading wicket-taker in this season&#8217;s Sunfoil Series and delivered 15 economical overs to finish with 1/33. Allan Donald, legendary fast bowler and bowling coach at the Knights, has already said Olivier has the ability to become a Test bowler.
