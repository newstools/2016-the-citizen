South African Afro-pop legend Robbie Malinga took to the stage at the Tsogo Sun Silver Star Casino, on Friday to entertain fans and supporters of his music. Malinga, who has contributed tremendously to the careers of many artists in the South African music industry, was accompanied by other chart-topping artists. The event, which was in partnership with Albany Bread, Ace and Golden Cloud, saw a mass of people singing along to their favourite tunes way past the hours of midnight. Not only did fans get to relive Malinga s career with stories told in song, they also got an out-of-this-world concert as the likes of Musa, Karabo, Ntando, Sfiso, Naima Kay and Zahara performed their smash hits, produced by the legendary Malinga over the years. Fans were thrilled to watch songs like Mthande, Sokwenzenjani and many others being performed live to celebrate his career. The gorgeous Chef Nti further tantalised fans taste buds with a delicious eight-course menu, served to all. The Night of the Hitmaker is part of a concert series where living legends will be celebrated for their contribution to the country s industry. We are a proudly South African brand and believe in celebrating all that is authentically South African, said Percy Masemene, brand manager for Albany. It was truly great to see South Africans celebrate Malinga and his astonishing contribution to music over the years. Sama and Metro FM Music award-winning musician Zahara said: It s an honour to celebrate my mentor and brother, Robbie, who has been a vital part of mine and other major musicians careers. Just my name alone, Zahara, comes from Robbie. I am for ever thankful.
