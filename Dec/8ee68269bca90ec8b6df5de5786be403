Divock Origi scored for the fourth consecutive match after Darren Randolph&#8217;s blunder to save a point for frail Liverpool, who sit third, six points behind leaders Chelsea. Liverpool goalkeeper Loris Karius last week gifted Bournemouth a winner and Klopp&#8217;s side &#8212; so good going forward and top of the table last month &#8212; are being regularly undermined by their defensive failings. Karius&#8217; positioning on Sunday for West Ham midfielder Dimitri Payet&#8217;s equaliser, which cancelled out Adam Lallana&#8217;s opener, was questionable. Michail Antonio then capitalised on a mistake by Joel Matip to put the visitors 2-1 up before Origi&#8217;s fortuitous 48th-minute leveller. Klopp was hardly convincing in his defence of the German stopper Karius, 23, saying merely that he had &#8220;no idea&#8221; about whether his summer signing was at fault for the Payet free-kick strike because he had only seen it once. But the Liverpool boss was clearly not happy with the way Liverpool were opened up by the Hammers at Anfield. &#8220;Nearly everybody was involved in our offensive situations and we had two centre-backs and sometimes Hendo (Jordan Henderson) behind the ball, and nearly everybody else the other side,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We had a problem with second balls but not too often. The goals (we conceded) weren&#8217;t in situations like that but we let the game go a little bit away in these moments, we were not completely in control like we could have been.&#8221; Klopp acknowledged that on current form it will be difficult to catch red-hot Chelsea, who have won their last nine Premier League matches and now look the team to beat. &#8220;It s difficult to stay in the race with Chelsea when they win everything. This is the moment to collect as many points as possible,&#8221; he said, calling for his side to remain calmer in future. &#8220;The way to get a real top-flight team is for them to make the right decisions, and stay cool.&#8221;
