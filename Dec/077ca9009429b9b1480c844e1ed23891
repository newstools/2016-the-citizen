It s quite a novelty to go through a Fairview card this year and see the name Gavin Lerena. The former champion returns from a short suspension today, to what could be a handful of winners. He rides Wonder Worker in Race 5 a FM 68 Handicap over 2000m on the Polytrack. Lerena rode this four-year-old daughter of Western Winter on her last outing when an extremely unlucky third, 2.75 lengths behind Treize during this year s International jockeys challenge. A lot can be said to defend that performance. It came after a short break; she ll be at her peak now; she was denied galloping room after being cramped at the 250m mark and the race was over 1600m she s shown a preference for further so will enjoy 2000m. A number of runners are held on form by this Justin Snaith-trained filly. She defeated Conquering Queen by 1.25 lengths and La Myst by 0.25 lengths. Alan Greeff-trained Sanctuary has the highest merit rating in the race and has beaten five of the eight runners competing. She however shoulders 62kg 5.5kg more than Wonder Worker, which could prove her biggest disadvantage. Much therefore is in the favour of this Justin Snaith-trained filly. She s running on conditions which should maximise her chances of winning. She jumps from draw No. 7 and returns to the Polytrack, where she s run some of her best races.
