The 44-year-old &#8211; who won three Premier League titles, an FA Cup and the 1999 Champions League during his three year stay at United &#8211; has said he fears for his job if a proposed takeover of the club goes through despite guiding them to the heady heights of third in the table. In a draw short of the &#8216;romance of the Cup&#8217; the remaining non league clubs failed to get paired with a Premier League club. There are, though, four all Premier League clashes. The most eyecatching is Everton hosting struggling champions Leicester with both those sides realistic goal of domestic silverware reduced to the Cup. Pep Guardiola&#8217;s Manchester City travel to West Ham, who like Leicester are hopelessly out of sorts, and four other relegation battlers are pitched in against each other Hull hosting Swansea and Sunderland at home to Burnley.
