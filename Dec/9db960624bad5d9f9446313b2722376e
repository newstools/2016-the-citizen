Sunday World reports that Jali has a lover that he has been seeing secretly. Jali is engaged to Nonhle Ndala and they have a daughter together. The soccer player asked Andile Nkosi to buy flight tickets to Belgium where she would have joined him for a romantic rendezvous. But on the evening before Nkosi was supposed to leave for Belgium, Jali told her to stay put as he was coming down to play for the national soccer team. Nkosi had already paid R16,000 for the trip and sought to be refunded. According to Sunday World, Jali and Nkosi met up in Pretoria at the Southern Sun in Menlyn where they had &#8216;wild&#8217; sex and though Jali wanted to do so without a condom, Nkosi says she insisted they use one.
