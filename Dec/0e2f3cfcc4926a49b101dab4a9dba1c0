&#8220;At midnight, Netcare 911 paramedics responded to a stabbing incident in Ridge Road, Margate, spokesman Chris Botha said. Reports from the scene indicated that an eighteen-year-old man had sustained a stab wound to the chest. Paramedics arrived at the scene and found the teenager lying on the ground. Tragically, he had died before our arrival due to the extensive injury that he sustained. Exact detail as to the cause of the stabbing is still speculative and will form part of the South African Police [Service] investigation, Botha said. African News Agency (ANA)
