You know a shisanyama and lounge is lit when it has a website and a Facebook page, and Eyadini Lounge is no different. The lounge, found in uMlazi, KwaZulu-Natal, is probably one of the most talked about in Mzansi. The lounge is so popular it has even created its own celebrities, such as Zodwa Wabantu. For those who have not heard of her, Zodwa Wabantu is that one person who takes to the dance floor and impresses everyone with her dancing skills, in heels! Watch a video compilation of her getting down posted on YouTube by SA Trending Videos: However, Zodwa is not the only one, as the place attracts the best dancers in Mzansi. Watch Arly Frost getting down at the lounge in heels too. Video posted on YouTube by South Africa Daily. If you do not want to go there as yourself for whatever reason, it is safe to go there as someone else, as long as you have fun. Watch the video posted on the lounge&#8217;s Facebook page: It also serves as the perfect spot for lovers to take their relationships to the next level. This past weekend a man took his woman there and went down on one knee. Though there were negative comments, most said it did not matter where it happened, as long as he put a ring on it.
