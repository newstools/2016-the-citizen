The Blitzboks are surely odds-on favourites to win consecutive Cape Town Sevens titles &#8211; and a fourth South African tournament in a row &#8211; after comfortably disposing of the Australians 29-7 in the final game of Saturday&#8217;s first day. Given that Neil Powell&#8217;s unbeaten troops face Wales in Sunday&#8217;s first quarterfinal (kick-off at 12:04) &#8211; a team they beat in last week&#8217;s semifinal in Dubai &#8211; their progress seems close to guaranteed. Especially if they continue this type of form. Once again, their uncanny patience was something to marvel at as they took their opportunities ruthlessly and kept calm if they didn&#8217;t immediately hit the gaps against niggly opponents. It took them until the fifth minute for captain Philip Snyman to score the first try but it was a sign of things to come.

South Africa would continue to use that tactic to good effect and it infuriated the Australians to such an extent that the veteran James Stannard was lucky to escape a yellow card following a late tackle on Du Preez that led to Cecil Afrika&#8217;s try. That said, the move still needed Afrika&#8217;s jinxing feet to be rounded off. Snyman&#8217;s power made the game safe shortly after half-time, following Kyle Brown&#8217;s skillful turnover at a ruck before Ruhan Nel&#8217;s long-range run put the icing on the cake. Point-scorers: Blitzboks (17) &#8211; Tries: Philip Snyman (2), Kyle Brown, Cecil Afrika, Ruhan Nel. Conversion: Branco du Preez. Australia (0) &#8211; Try: Sam Myers. Conversion: James Stannard.
