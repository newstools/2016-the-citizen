A would-be carjacker&#8217;s luck ran out when he approached a car in a driveway, only to find that the owner had a gun. In a video posted by Thokozani Dlamini on Facebook page Stolen Cars RSA, a man can be seen walking outside of a gate. He was walking to his car, which was parked outside, when he thought to double-check if he had locked the gate. The video is dated 2013 but has recently surfaced on social media. He got out and went back to his car when another car drove by him. The driver of the car driving by then suddenly parked on the side of the road, and one guy with a balaclava got out as his accomplice followed. As he was trying to threaten the driver, the driver took out his gun and shot the man, who then fell to the ground. It is unclear if he succumbed to the gunshot wound. His accomplice saw that things weren&#8217;t going as planned and ran back to his car and drove off. Watch the video below:
