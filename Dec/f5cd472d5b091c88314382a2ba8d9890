President Jacob Zuma has asked the High Court in Pretoria to review and set aside the remedial action recommendations in the public protector s State of Capture report. According to court papers published on the eNCA website, Zuma filed an affidavit on Friday, in which he questions former public protector Thuli Madonsela s recommendation in the report that he establish a commission of inquiry but that it be headed by a judge selected by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng. He also wants the court to refer the report back to new Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane for further investigation. He contends that the recommendation is inconsistent with the rule of law, the Constitution, and breaches the separation of powers principle. According to the court papers, he argues that the decision to establish a commission of inquiry and who will head it is his prerogative. The report, released shortly before Madonsela left office at the end of October, includes details of an alleged improper relationship between Zuma and the wealthy, politically connected Gupta family. It recommends, among other things, that these, and other allegations, be investigated by a judicial commission of inquiry to be headed by a judge appointed by Mogoeng. African News Agency (ANA)
