When the Titans take the field in Friday&#8217;s domestic T20 final against the Warriors in Centurion, they can be chuffed about two things. They&#8217;ve definitely been the best side in this season&#8217;s tournament. And, perhaps more satisfyingly, they provide the benchmark for coping with Cricket South Africa&#8217;s stringent quota requirements. The fast-bowling trio of Malusi Siboto, Junior Dala and Lungi Ngidi have not only played in almost all of the Titans&#8217; matches but also taken 30 wickets between them. In other words, these three players haven&#8217;t only been given an extended opportunity &#8211; they&#8217;ve been key players.

Malusi is one of the most experienced bowlers in franchise cricket, Junior has the typical energy of a fast bowler and young Lungi is like a sponge. He&#8217;s keen to learn. &#8220;It&#8217;s nice combination of players. They complement each other well.&#8221; In a system where many teams seem to concentrate on merely meeting CSA&#8217;s requirements &#8211; three black African players must be included in every game &#8211; the Titans have do it differently. They&#8217;ve realised black players not only need opportunities. They need to flourish as well. Siboto (12 wickets), Dala (11) and Ngidi (7) certainly have. &#8220;Their skill levels are pretty high,&#8221; said Boucher. &#8220;They&#8217;re also completely different bowlers, which means they give (captain) Albie Morkel different options. &#8220;In fact, Albie has the luxury of deciding who of those three are most suitable to bowling to different types of batsmen. They&#8217;ve really played well this season.&#8221; But the former Proteas wicketkeeper knows that will count for nothing if they don&#8217;t deliver Friday evening.

It&#8217;s amazing how far attitude with a bit of talent can bring you.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter. &nbsp;
