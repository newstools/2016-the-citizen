According to a report in Sunday World, &#8220;hundreds of farmers&#8221; are up in arms over allegations that a senior manager in charge of popular soapie Isibaya is a stock thief. A farmer, Chris Mabunda, opened three cases of stock theft after his goats, cattle and sheep were stolen in 2014 and 2015. Bizarrely, he then saw one of his stolen goats on Isibaya in &#8220;a scene depicting rural settings&#8221;. Mabunda has alleged that the thieves used a vehicle belonging to Bomb Productions, which produces the soapie. Sunday World says it has even seen a sworn affidavit from the show&#8217;s producer in which he reportedly admits to being the &#8220;mastermind&#8221; behind the stock thefts and commits to settling the matter with the farmers. Mabunda has reportedly been shocked, though, that no arrests have been made.

They are demanding compensation from Isibaya and a public statement on the matter; reportedly, a protest to the soapie&#8217;s Joburg studios on Thursday is being planned. Isibaya&#8217;s producer Kutlwano Ditsele denied any involvement in crime and said they were conducting an internal investigation. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
