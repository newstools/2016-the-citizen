Circus owner Brian Boswell is reportedly challenging the legality of elephant protection laws after his attempt to sell African elephants to a zoo in the United Arab Emirates was blocked by the authorities. The Conservation Action Trust reported on Friday that Boswell had apparently refused to accept the denial of his permit application to send five circus-trained elephants to a Dubai zoo at the selling price of R3 million each. Boswell has mounted a high court challenge to the 2008 Elephant Norms and Standards (ENS) code, which he claims cannot be enforced . The trust noted that the respondents the Department of Environmental Affairs and Ezemvelo Kwazulu-Natal Wildlife have said Boswell s case was flawed, since he had apparently misinterpreted the law regarding listed, threatened or protected species, as well as the National Environmental Management: Bio-diversity Act, which stated legislation of the ENS was binding and enforceable . The ENS code states no wild or captive elephant may be imported to or exported from South Africa, and circus elephants may only be temporarily exported or imported for the duration of a performance. The trust claimed Boswell said his rights to trade had been ignored and the delay in receiving his permits has caused him loss of income. Meanwhile, animal welfare experts charge that elephant training methods are cruel, that captivity disrupts elephant family bonds, and that low breeding and high birth mortality rates of elephants in captivity indicate how bad captivity is. In 2013, protesters approached parliament to have the Animal Protection Act amended to ban animals in circuses after TV footage depicted Boswell circus handlers abusing elephants was aired on national television.
