The French publishers of a book of lost Vincent van Gogh sketches on Monday threatened legal action against a Dutch museum that has questioned the authenticity of the works. The threat follows the publication in six countries last month of Vincent Van Gogh, the fog of Arles: the rediscovered sketchbook in which sketches apparently from the artist s stay in the southern French city are reproduced. The Vincent Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, however, has dismissed the sketches as fakes. Publishing house Le Seuil intends to obtain compensation for the damage they have suffered as a result of an insidious, unfounded campaign .
