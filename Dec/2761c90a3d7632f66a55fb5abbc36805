Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba says the city has identified corruption as a key threat to achieving our governmental objectives . He told The Citizen this week that fighting the scourge would be under the spotlight in the new year. Mashaba said he would reveal disturbing figures with regard to officials involved in corruption in the city. It was more than corruption in the City of Johannesburg, and what I regard as blatant looting of state resources, Mashaba said. Corruption steals from the poor and puts strain on government to deliver on its responsibility. The mayor said the DA-led administration was determined to root out those found in the wrong. When the leadership turns a blind eye on corruption, the entire system gets affected and service delivery suffers in the process. Mashaba s comments were prompted by the recent axing of city group audit and assurance services head Sinaye Nxumalo. This after Mashaba&#8217;s administration unearthed forensic reports of alleged corruption in the city that Nxumalo had failed to submit to Auditor-General Kimi Makwetu. Former Gauteng Hawks head Shadrack Sibiya was even roped in to lead the city s anti-corruption unit. Asked what Johannesburg residents should expect in 2017, Mashaba replied: The adjustment budget at the end of February, followed by the approval of the 2017/18 budget. These two events are going to allow us the process of implementing our own programmes. Working with the private sector, inner-city regeneration has to be prioritised. We also need the private sector to build low-cost housing for our people. ngwakom@citizen.co.za
