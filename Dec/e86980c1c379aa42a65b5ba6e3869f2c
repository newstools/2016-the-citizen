Rwanda&#8217;s Democratic Green party president Frank Habineza, head of the only government-recognised opposition party, announced Saturday he would stand as a candidate at next year&#8217;s presidential election. &#8220;I have accepted your request to represent you as the presidential candidate for the upcoming presidential election which will take place on 4th August 2017,&#8221; Habineza said after a meeting of party leaders in Kigali. Only incumbent Paul Kagame, who has been in power since 1994, had previously come forward as a candidate. A constitutional amendment passed this year means Kagame &#8212; in charge since taking power at the head of a rebel army 22 years ago &#8212; is able to stand for re-election for another seven-year term. &#8220;We want to bring democracy to this country&#8221; Habineza told reporters. &#8220;Democracy does not come from the sky, it won&#8217;t come from America or Europe, we are the ones who have to fight for it&#8221; Rwanda is regularly praised for its stability and economic performance but criticised for a lack of political freedoms. Several opposition parties &#8212; including the United Democratic Forces (FDU) &#8212; are not officially recognised and cannot participate in elections. FDU leader Victoire Ingabire was arrested in 2010 while campaigning against Kagame. sa-ndy/pvh/har 1994-2016 Agence France-Presse
