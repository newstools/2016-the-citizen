1. I am a 23-year-old singer and songwriter from the Eastern Cape. Music is my chosen obsession as it holds a special place in my heart. I even studied it because it brings me joy. 2. As a little girl, I knew that I wanted be a singer. I remember telling my mother that I would one day be a famous singer this is my childhood dream. I still get excited when I see people appreciating my music. When my album dropped, it was humbling to see them enjoying and praising it. 3. Sometimes I find it hard to deal with people s expectations of me. This is because creating music is a personal venture. Sometimes I feel like everyone just wants a piece of me, and I am learning to deal with that. 4. I learnt a lot after getting eliminated from the top 16 of SA Idols season 11. Being eliminated taught me the importance of perseverance and persistence. I also learnt about the huge impact and power that social media has on the industry. 5. It was an honour to be part of the Reconciliation Festival. I was speechless when I was approached to be part of the line-up that included artists such as Lira and Zonke. The energy and the feedback from the crowd was a remarkable experience. Brought to you by Bona Magazine For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
