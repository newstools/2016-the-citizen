The fan was referring to a picture of Obama and Donald Trump shaking hands at the White House, with the former looking rather dejected. Another asked him when he was going to interview President Jacob Zuma, adding that Zuma would first set up a commission of inquiry to investigate if the interview is necessary. The comedian and author has previously interviewed political figures including former President Bill Clinton, who received the gift of a balloon drop. The funny gesture follows videos and pictures on social media showing the former president getting excited at the sight of balloons. He also interviewed Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson earlier this year. The Daily Show with Trevor Noah will air on Comedy Central (DSTV channel 122) tomorrow at 21:00 CAT.
