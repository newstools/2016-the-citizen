We are appalled by a disclosure from a source within the Independent Electoral Commission that the cash-strapped, publicly funded permanent body created by the Constitution to manage free and fair elections at all levels of government, should have seen the necessity to splurge R1.5 million on what looks very much like an expensive jolly in the countryside for its reported 120 delegates. Surely the cost of the rooms alone must have signalled an agonisingly loud warning bell. With rooms at the five-star retreat where the strategic workshop was held in the Magaliesberg ranging between R2 300 and R5 000 a night, the underlying honesty in any debate over the proposed R3 500 minimum wage is rendered both risible and repulsive and, while the IEC is independent of government, makes a mockery of the stated drive by the ruling party to clamp down on wasteful spending. It is certainly a slap in the face of the less privileged of our citizens eking out an existence from pay cheque to pay cheque. Surely, given the circumstances, the IEC could have circulated a concise agenda in advance to the cossetted delegates and used the far less costly device of resorting to conference calls.
