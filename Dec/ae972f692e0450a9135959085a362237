Matriculants who are currently receiving a social grant and are accepted at an institution of higher learning will no longer go through a means test to qualify for financial aid from the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (Nsfas). Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini said the decision supported the National Development Plan (NDP) Vision 2030 of creating an inclusive social protection system that addressed all areas of vulnerability, Northglen News reported. The aim is to track, locate and improve the well-being of poor and vulnerable learners with a host of social protection services. This simply means that support and money follows the learner. Secondly, few vulnerable and poor learners apply for financial assistance, said the minister. This year, 188 687 learners who sat for their matric examinations received a social grant. Of this number, 173 085 receive the Child Support Grant, while 14 926 receive the Foster Child Grant and 676 are on the Disability Grant. Nsfas was initiated by government to offer tertiary education financial assistance to South African students whose parents or guardians cannot afford tertiary education. &#8211; Caxton News Service For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
