Faf du Plessis on Wednesday confirmed, in an official unveiling of sorts as the new Test captain, he won&#8217;t back down on his appeal against ball-tampering charges. It&#8217;s left many people in the cricketing fraternity jittery. The International Cricket Council (ICC) have previously stated their judicial commissioner has the power to impose a heavier penalty on Du Plessis if his appeal fails.

Even the hearing that took place, how everything works when it comes to those hearings. For me, it s the principle of standing up for something which you don t agree with.&#8221; That&#8217;s all good and well but if Du Plessis is banned, who takes over from him? Linda Zondi, the convenor of selectors, makes a rational argument in this case. &#8220;At the moment, we&#8217;ll look into a once-off arrangement, especially if Faf is only banned for one game,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve decided to wait until January for the board to debate and appoint a permanent vice-captain.&#8221; That would probably mean a reluctant Hashim Amla, who quit as full-time Test captain early in January, will be asked to stand in. Yet it would also make sense to speed up the process and maybe pick the guy the Proteas already have in mind to be vice-captain in future. In that case, a hard arse like Dean Elgar would come to the fore as he&#8217;s a proven leader at lower levels. Either way, it&#8217;s an intriguing issue but one that probably can be put on the back-burner for the series against Sri Lanka. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
