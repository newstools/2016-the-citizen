As co-founders of the African National Congress armed wing, uMkhonto weSizwe (MK), the image of the MK Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) was a concern for the SA Communist Party (SACP), party secretary general Blade Nzimande said on Friday. The SACP had written a letter to the MKMVA leadership to discuss their concerns, he said. MK was founded by both ANC and SACP, as equal co-founders, that is why it was led by [former president Nelson] Mandela and [former SACP leader Joe] Slovo so the image of the MKMVA is very important to us, including the role played by previous members. We have a direct interest, said Nzimande. The MKMVA celebrated its 55th anniversary at an award ceremony on Friday in Ekurhuleni. President Jacob Zuma, who was to deliver a key note speech, did not speak. Cooperative Governance Minister Des van Rooyen cited ill health as a reason Zuma did not attend. Former Eskom boss Brian Molefe, SAA board chairwoman Dudu Miyeni and the SABC s Hlaudi Motsoeneng were billed to receive non-combatant awards, but also did not show up. Former MK generals were expected to hold a meeting in Johannesburg on Saturday where the state of the beleaguered ruling party would be discussed. Its organisers said the MK council would see all former MK members recognise the role played by the men and women who helped liberate the country. Nzimande said the SACP recognised MKMVA and that the former MK members meeting was necessary and should take place. The council should take place, we have no problem with that. We hope that after discussing everything, they will then seek to engage the rest of the movement. It does not mean SACP does not recognise the MKMVA we recognise it and even wrote to them, so want to engage them in the new year.
