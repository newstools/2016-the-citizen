While many Durban residents are still reeling from the shocking armed robbery at a bank in Musgrave, video footage of the incident has emerged, reports the Berea Mail. According to Berea police communications officer, Captain PN Naidoo, the victim was in the parking lot, about to enter the bank to make a deposit when a man emerged from a Golf 7 and approached him with a firearm. The man ran into the bank and threw a bag of money to the teller but the suspect brandished a large firearm and went after the money bag and took it, he said. Naidoo encouraged the public to remain calm in such situations. Try not to look at the robbers, or interfere, as your lives are more important, he said. No arrests have been made at this stage of investigations. Meanwhile, it is alleged the bag contained R100 000. Caxton News Service More news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
