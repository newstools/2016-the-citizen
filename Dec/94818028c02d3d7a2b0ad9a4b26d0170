When her mother found out she was eating sponge at the age of six, Candice Knox got a hiding and was told to stop eating the car , reports the Benoni City Times. This did very little to stop her craving for sponge, and she continued to tear out, chew and eat sponge from underneath the car seat. My favourite kind of sponge to eat contains holes and is brown in colour; I love the texture, said Knox, who works in Benoni. Today, the 35-year-old cannot go a day without enjoying a bite, or five, of her favourite snack and usually takes about a week or two to finish a whole sponge. It s a serious addiction. If I hear the word sponge or see an advert on TV, then the craving begins, and I have to have some, Knox said. I have a sponge at home, in my car and at work because I cannot go without it. I used to hide it from people, but now I just get it out the way so that people aren t shocked. Doctors have told her a lack of iron causes this strange eating habit and that she needs to take iron supplements, but these haven t helped much. She has, surprisingly, never become ill from her addiction. I take supplements almost every day, but these don t stop me from wanting to eat sponge. Knox said that when her mother told her she would be getting a sponge cake for her seventh birthday, she was elated. I spent my birthday sulking because I found out the sponge cake was not made of actual sponge, Knox said. Her family and friends have since accepted her addiction, and she receives sponges as a gifts. I wouldn t recommend anyone else eats sponge, but I cannot do without it; I don t think I want to.
