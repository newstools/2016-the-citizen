South African sport stars don&#8217;t often speak their mind in public. It&#8217;s understandable in the professional era, where one slip of the tongue can cost a player lots of money. But it also means press conferences and media events are quite boring. That&#8217;s not the case in America, where Richard Sherman, a cornerback for Seattle, continuously speaks his mind without worrying about the consequences. On Tuesday, he was in the news again after saying the NFL&#8217;s &#8211; the American Football league &#8211; games on Thursday&#8217;s are &#8220;poopfests&#8221;. Sherman&#8217;s biggest complaint is that games on Thursdays means players are only &#8220;50% to 60%&#8221; recovered by the next match, which is important in a dangerous sport.
