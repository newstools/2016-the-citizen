A man, believed to be in his late 20s, was in a critical condition on Friday morning after he was knocked down by a car on the N3 Highway near the Church off-ramp in Pietermaritzburg, paramedics said. Spokesperson Russel Meiring said paramedics arrived on the scene at approximately 08h00 and found both the car and patient in the emergency lane of the highway. Local authorities closed off one lane of the road while paramedics assessed the man. Upon assessment, paramedics found that the man had sustained numerous injuries and was in a critical condition, Meiring said. Paramedics treated the man and provided him with advanced life support interventions, before he was transported to Greys Hospital for further care. The driver of the light motor vehicle was assessed and found to have escaped injury, although visibly shaken, he said. The details surrounding the incident are not yet known but local authorities were on scene for further investigations.
