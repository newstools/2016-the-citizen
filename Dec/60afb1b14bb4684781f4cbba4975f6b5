The Proteas already have a busy 2017 ahead of them &#8211; including a four-month tour of England mid-year &#8211; but it won&#8217;t stop there. Cricket South Africa (CSA) on Thursday announced that both India and Australia will be touring South Africa next season. India will headline the summer with their visit that includes four Tests, five One-day Internationals and three T20s. It&#8217;s in stark contrast to the drama of 2013, when the Indian Cricket Board (BCCI) disgracefully broke their agreement of a full tour and only came for two Tests and three ODIs. Australia then arrive for a four-Test series in February and March 2018. CSA hope to have those itineraries finalised next week. Another bumper season of attractive international cricket awaits our fans, said CSA chief executive Haroon Lorgat in a statement. India and Australia finished 2016 as the top teams on the ICC rankings list and this will give our players great incentive to perform at their very best. We have not beaten Australia in a home Test series since unity and that surely must be good reason to perform in order to bank a notable first.&#8221; Yet South African cricket&#8217;s smaller centres can also look forward to international action. Test cricket returns to Senwes Park in Potchefstroom for the first time since 2002 as it will host the first of Two Tests against Bangladesh at the end of September next year. Bloemfontein will host the second five-day battle. Kimberley, Paarl and East London are the venues respectively for the three-match One-day series before the tour concludes with T20s at the two Test grounds. Bangladesh tour itinerary: September 21-23: SA Invitation XI, Benoni. September 28-October 2: 1st Test, Potchefstroom. October 6-10: 2nd Test, Bloemfontein.
