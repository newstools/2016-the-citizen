1 hr + time, to cool THE FLAVOUR COMBINATIONS HONEY CAKE 150g cake flour 7.5ml (1 tsp) baking powder pinch salt 2.5ml ( tsp) ground cinnamon zest of orange 150g butter, softened 160g sugar 3 eggs 60ml ( cup) milk 100g walnuts, roughly chopped SYRUP 375g honey 180ml ( cup) water juice of lemon HOW TO DO IT 1 Preheat the oven to 180 C. Grease and line the base of a 25cm-square baking tin. Combine the flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon and orange zest in a medium bowl and set aside until needed. In a large bowl and using electric beaters, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the flour mixture and milk to the butter-egg mixture and, using a spatula, gently fold through to combine. 2 Fold in the walnuts and pour the batter into the prepared baking tin. Bake in the preheated oven until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean, about 35 40 minutes. 3 For the syrup (while the cake bakes), combine all of the ingredients and bring to a simmer, 3 minutes. Pour the syrup over the cake just as it comes out of the oven. 4 Allow the cake to cool, about 30 minutes, before cutting it into 4cm squares. &nbsp;
