Thinking of competing in a marathon but put off by the distance? Easy. Pay someone to run it for you. The death of a runner in a half marathon in China&#8217;s southeastern city of Xiamen this month has highlighted an unexpected form of cheating. When a runner suffered a heart attack and collapsed 4.5 km from the finish line, at first it seemed like a tragic death. But a subsequent investigation revealed that the victim was actually running on behalf of someone else. The trickster has since been given a life ban from competing in the event, the Xinhua news agency reported. According to the Beijing Youth Daily, 30 of the 18,000 people who had registered to participate in the December 10 event were disqualified. Reasons for the bans were not given, but the paper said high school students were told they could earn credits towards university entrance examinations if they finished in the top 100 places in the race, hinting at one possible motive for cheating. Critics took to social media to attack the cheats while others blamed race organisers. &#8220;Without any systematic training or willpower, what they want is to take photos and tell the world on social media that they are leading a fashionably &#8216;healthy&#8217; life,&#8221; Xinhua quoted a poster named Chiphell as saying on one microblogging site. Organisers acknowledged that it was possible for a non-runner to pick up another person&#8217;s bib, partly to help out-of-towners who may not be able to do so in person. &#8220;Trading of number bibs is banned, but it is also hard to detect,&#8221; a committee member told Xinhua. Such cheating is not entirely new. In 2010, some runners in the Xiamen marathon were disqualified for covering part of the route by bus. Xinhua quoted one marathon runner surnamed Liu as saying he had witnessed all kinds of cheating at races. Those who failed to get a number in the lottery could buy one from lucky registrants or simply take their chances by mixing into the crowd on the race track, he said. Others who wanted a finisher&#8217;s certificate but did not want to actually complete the race would either have someone else run for them or take shortcuts on the course, he said. &#8220;The organisers should first be blamed for the chaos,&#8221; another runner named Gao told Xinhua. &#8220;Once I saw a man running with a woman&#8217;s number bib. The bib colours for male and female runners are different. Anyone who was not colour-blind could easily spot it, but all the referees along the route just turned a blind eye.&#8221; The tactic recalls the case of unremarkable Cuban runner Rosie Ruiz who won the Boston marathon in 1980 before suspicious officials realised she had taken the subway for part of the race and emerged from a station not far from the finish line.
