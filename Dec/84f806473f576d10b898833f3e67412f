Annanias Mathe, the serial rapist and armed robber who made history when he became the only person to have ever escaped from Pretoria s C-Max prison, has died. Mathe had been suffering complications from a digestive issue . He died on Tuesday afternoon in the King Edward VIII Hospital. It was not immediately known what the cause of death was and why he was in hospital, but the official said that the department would be issuing a statement later in the day. Mathe, a Mozambican national, was convicted of 64 charges, including rape, attempted rape, attempted murder, robbery and theft. Mathe&#8217;s nickname was the &#8220;Houdini of C-Max&#8221; after two successful breakouts from secure prison facilities. He also staged numerous other escape attempts. Mathe escaped from Johannesburg Central police station in 2005. The Mozambican was also the first person to escape from the notorious C-Max prison in Pretoria in 2006. He stripped and covered himself in Vaseline to climb out of the 20cm by 60cm window in his cell. He broke through the wall surrounding the window to remove it before breaking off two steel bars from his bed to wedge on either side of the window to help him slide his shoulders out. He used his clothes and bed linen to lower himself down the prison&#8217;s wall and even left a message for the warders that said: &#8220;F**k you&#8221;. Six prison warders were dismissed in connection with his escape bid. He was recaptured a month later. He made headlines several times in the years since for nearly succeeding in further daring escape attempts, including from a Kokstad prison, believed to be the most secure facility in the country. There were two escape attempts at Ebongweni C-Max Prison near Kokstad, with the most recent attempt being earlier this year. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
