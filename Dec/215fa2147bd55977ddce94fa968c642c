The Proteas win by 206 runs! 10.57: GONE! Kagiso Rabada in the attack and he delivers a brute of a ball that Dhusmantha Chameera can only glove to Quinton de Kock. SL 274/9. 10.40: WICKET! The end is nigh now for Sri Lanka! Herath, clearly protective of his sore fingers, plays a defensive shot poorly and it pops up for Vernon Philander to make a brilliant one-handed grab off his own bowling. SL 262/8. 10.36: OUT! Kyle Abbott&#8217;s got another LBW and the last recognised batsman. Dhananjaya de Silva is trapped on the back foot by one that comes back in. He needs to review but fails. SL 258/7. 10.24: Dhananjaya de Silva looks a splendid young player. He takes Sri Lanka past 250 with a beautiful off-drive. Remember, this is an opener batting a number 7. Nice weapon to have. SL 253/6. 10.16: Abbott smacks Rangana Herath on his bowling fingers with a nasty delivery that spits from a length. The veteran already has both his spinning fingers strapped. The tourists will hope there&#8217;s no damage. 10.14: GONE! Kyle Abbott gets the key wicket! Angelo Mathews moves across his stumps but misses the clip to leg. The appeal is a long one and Bruce Oxenford eventually raises the finger. Mathews reviews but umpire&#8217;s call stands. SL 246/6. 10.07: Two overs have been bowled and there hasn&#8217;t been much alarm. South Africa will have to work hard once again. SL 246/5. 9.40: Thursday was a strange day. In fact, it was mediocre in many senses. Read our match report here. 9.38: The Proteas really can&#8217;t have thoughts of their opponents having a chance. The last pair of specialist batters are at the crease and the new ball is still, well, new. The hosts should be in the driving seat. 9.35: It&#8217;s the final day at St George&#8217;s Park and it is mildly surprising that we&#8217;re still here. Sri Lanka have hung on well in their second innings but surely a target of 488 is simply too much? For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
