One of the men accused of being part of a gang of men who drowned two husbands in a lake and sexually assaulted their wives in the horrific Rhodes Park in Johannesburg last year, on Wednesday continued to deny having any part of it. Thabo Nkala, 25, and his co-accused, Edmore Ndlovu, and Mduduzi Lawrence Mathibela, 32, have all claimed to have been severely beaten by police into making confessions. On Wednesday, Nkala, an illegal immigrant from Zimbabwe, denied knowing his co-accused or even having knowledge of Rhodes Park where the attack took place. He also denied being part of the eight men who were seen on the CCTV footage running away from the crime scene. The 25-year-old, who has shaved his dreadlocks off, further told the high court sitting at the Palm Ridge Magistrate s Court that his street name was not Rasta and that the reason he removed his hair was because of prison conditions. Judge Papi Masopa then agreed to adjourn the matter to Thursday as the court was busy with another matter. Nkala, Ndlovu, and Mathibela were allegedly part of a gang that attacked and robbed the two couples while they were taking an evening stroll through the park on October 17 last year. All three accused have pleaded not guilty and claim they were severely assaulted by police and forced into making confessions. Their claims were dismissed after the court conducted a trial-within-a-trial. African News Agency For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
