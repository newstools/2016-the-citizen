The South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco) on Sunday urged authorities to clamp down on reckless driving. This comes after numerous fatal road accidents over the festive season so far, including a head-on collision involving a bus and a minibus taxi on the N1 about 10km from Worcester in the Western Cape, in which 13 people died. Passenger safety should be uppermost in the minds of public transport drivers. Heavy penalties must follow overtaking on a barrier line and whenever lives of other road-users are put at risk, Sanco national spokesman Jabu Mahlangu said. He condemned speeding and reckless driving, believed to have been the cause of the N1 crash, and conveyed condolences to the families that lost their loved ones. Mahlangu said many innocent lives were prematurely lost on public roads due to irresponsible driver behaviour. Speed law enforcement must be intensified to deal harshly with speedsters that are robbing families of precious lives of breadwinners and their loved ones. Road traffic law violations should have serious consequences, including suspension and cancellation of a person s driver s license, to reduce the carnage on the roads, he said.
