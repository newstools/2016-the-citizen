Minister of Sports and Recreation Fikile Mbalula made a statement on his Facebook page on Wednesday that left followers wondering exactly what he was saying. We think it is important that someone, especially Kaizer Chiefs coach Steve Komphela, decrypt the message for us since he&#8217;s the only one who can. The minister could be trying to warn us against an alien invasion or a life-threatening event, and we wouldn&#8217;t even know. He wrote: &#8220;I&#8217;m told by those who understand politics that the idea by the ANC NEC not to recall President Zuma has caused a miasma of deprecable apothesis of a hemorrhagic oozing into a malodorousness excrescences of mobocracy. With all termagant its ossifying proclivities of cacistocracy and our knowledgia centura is enveloped in a paraplegic crinkum. What are your thoughts?&#8221; What we know is that the matter is of national importance, as we can see the words &#8216;ANC NEC&#8217; and &#8216;President Jacob Zuma&#8217; in that paragraph. We are pleading with the dictionary- and thesaurus-armed coach to help us translate what the minister is saying. Komphela has often been made fun of on Twitter, mostly after matches when he gives his speeches. He has left many wondering what he is saying, something that has even been blamed for the team&#8217;s losses. Even EFF deputy president Floyd Shivambu shared with his followers that the team will start winning matches the day they hire a coach the players can understand.
