African National Congress (ANC) secretary general Gwede Mantashe on Wednesday said he had witnessed hatred from a majority of members of the ruling party s highest decision-making body, the national executive committee (NEC), during a tense extended meeting of the group that started over the weekend.

One of the things that came out of the meeting was the depth of hatred among the comrades, let alone disagreeing. There is nothing wrong when people disagree. There is everything wrong with that disagreement becoming hatred. The secretary-general s revealing remarks are in clear contrast to his comments on Tuesday during a media briefing by the ANC on the outcomes of its extended NEC meeting, which had been described as the most serious and direct challenge to President Jacob Zuma s leadership, and shocked his staunch supporters. Mantashe said that discussions held in Irene, Tshwane, had been open and no Cabinet ministers were threatened with unemployment for calling on Zuma to step down. He encouraged ANC members to learn from Castro, saying he had loved his country and his colleagues.

It is the worst thing that can happen to our movement. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
