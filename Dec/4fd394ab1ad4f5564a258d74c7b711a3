The trending hashtag #WeAreDatingChallenge may or may not be producing real results in Mzansi, but the idea behind it can only lead to drama. People appear to have been sending people they aren&#8217;t dating messages in which they just randomly declare, out of the blue (and in one case &#8220;blew&#8221;), that they are now the other person&#8217;s boyfriend/girlfriend and that they&#8217;re dating. https://twitter.com/Mr_Chimidza/status/809857492146683905 Many of the responses to these audacious messages appear to be positive, with people ready to start getting romantic/sexual quite quickly, despite the fact that they may already be in relationships. People are just using this #WeAreDatingChallenge to test if they can make it out of friend zone &mdash; Mohammed Buhari (@buhariys) December 16, 2016 To some users, this &#8220;challenge&#8221; is proof that people you may not imagine would do so are actually ready to cheat on their partners at a moment&#8217;s notice. For others, it&#8217;s proof that one should never be scared to declare your romantic intentions to your crush, because they may just say yes. One person declared on Saturday that &#8220;I just got myself a bae thanks to #WeAreDatingChallenge.&#8221; Another said that his crush told him he was clearly &#8220;high&#8221;. https://twitter.com/OfficialHudan/status/809832654472433665 Hopefully some of the &#8220;victims&#8221; of the challenge are also in on the joke and just playing along. But we&#8217;re not so sure. #WeAreDatingChallenge this will not end well for some though. &mdash; God, she is (@Pr33tyD33p) December 17, 2016 What makes some of the screenshots of the messages supposedly going back and forth more amusing is how the people who take up the challenge try to get out of it if they get a surprising, embarrassing or outraged response. Often it&#8217;s done with a lot of humour.
