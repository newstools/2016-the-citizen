The South African government on Wednesday confirmed that the former First Vice President of South Sudan, Dr Riek Machar, was in the country, but denied reports that he was under house arrest. The Department of International Relations and Cooperation (Dirco) said in a statement that the South African Government had noted with concern some media reports about the presence of Dr Riek Machar in South Africa. Some of these media reports claim that Dr Riek Machar is under house arrest in South Africa . The statement made reference to the fact that the SA government had issued a statement on 13 October 2016 announcing the arrival in the country of Machar, as well as the purpose of his visit. In the October statement, Dirco said Machar was in the country on a private visit for medical reasons and that the length of his stay was unknown. Indeed, Dr Riek Machar is still in South Africa and the South African Government is taking care of him, given his profile, Dirco said on Wednesday. Furthermore, the Government is in constant consultations with the Government of South Sudan and the IGAD countries about Dr Riek Machar s presence in South Africa. South Africa wishes to reiterate her commitment to continue to work with the Government and the people of South Sudan in search of peace, stability and development. South Africa does this through her participation in the IGAD Plus mechanism, as well as the inter-party political dialogue which is facilitated by Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and the Chama Cha Mapinduzi of the United Republic of Tanzania.
