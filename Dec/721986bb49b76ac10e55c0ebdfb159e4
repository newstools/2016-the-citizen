Faf du Plessis will be able to captain the Proteas in their Test series against Sri Lanka but he&#8217;ll still carry the label of ball-tamperer. The 32-year-old skipper on Wednesday failed in his appeal against the International Cricket Council (ICC) to have his initial guilty verdict removed.

Michael Beloff, the judicial officer, ruled there was no evidence to suggest that Du Plessis hadn&#8217;t tried to change the condition of the ball in last month&#8217;s second Test against Australia in Hobart. As a result, he&#8217;ll still forfeit his entire match fee and the three demerit points against him stand. Those three points aren&#8217;t enough for Du Plessis to be banned but if he receives another he will have to sit a game out. In his official notes on his decision, Beloff paints a picture of a player using semantics to argue against laws that a pretty clear. The ICC&#8217;s argument was solely based on law 42.3, which states &#8220;any polishing can be regarded as changing the condition of the ball&#8221;. It also expressly prohibits both polishing the ball with an artificial substance and applying any artificial substance to the ball. &#8220;The evidence both of the visual footage and the Appellant s own testimony both prove conclusively that the Appellant polished the match ball with an artificial substance i.e. saliva containing a residue of mint,&#8221; Beloff wrote. Du Plessis and his legal representative there was no proof that he tried to change the condition of the ball. &#8220;(Du Plessis argued) it was for the umpires alone to assess whether the offence had been made out, but they inspected the ball both before and after the incident and noticed no change. Furthermore, no-one on the field complained about any change,&#8221; Beloff wrote. The Proteas skipper also said &#8220;expert scientific evidence&#8221; was needed to prove a &#8220;sugary residue&#8221; changes the condition of the ball. Yet Beloff was emphatic in his response. &#8220;The saliva/mint or the combination thereof was an artificial substance (although the saliva per se is not). If the drinking of gin is prohibited it is not a defence to say that it was mixed with tonic.&#8221; Dave Richardson, former Proteas wicketkeeper and ICC CEO, said he was &#8220;pleased with the outcome&#8221; and hopes that the ruling &#8220;acts as a deterrent for others&#8221;.
