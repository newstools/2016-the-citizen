Former Gauteng EFF leader Lufuno Gogoro has come out to criticise late gospel star Sfiso Ncwane. The gospel star died on Monday at the age of 37 of suspected kidney failure. Without substantiating the allegation, Gogoro repeats allegations that the gospel star did not respect his mother, as the Bible requires of those who believe in it. Gogoro says that although Ncwane was a good singer and husband, the same cannot be said of how he treated his mother. The man who has now become the sworn enemy of EFF leader Julius Malema further alleges the widely adored gospel star &#8220;went to his mother to ask for a kidney and his mother sent him [back] to the pastor&#8221;. The kidney story appears to come from clickbait news sites, and may not be true. Gogoro also criticises Ncwane for buying a Mercedes worth R1.9 million.

Ncwane, however, denied all these allegations, saying he took care of his mother and even built her a house. What I can say is that I take care of my family. When I was growing up, I used to say to God that one day when I have power, the people I want to take care of are people who brought me to this world , Ncwane said. When I started working, the first thing I did was to build a house at home for my mother. I bought furniture for her and made sure she was eating, he said. ALSO READ: I take care of my mother Sfiso Ncwane &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand why we have to bend the truth in order to suit ourselves?&#8221; wrote Gogoro, however. &#8220;The Bible set up a principle, a standard and instructions which we must follow. It says the greatest commandment is that you must love your mother and father so that you can have long life. And Jesus said the greatest commandment is love. &#8220;Love your neighbour as you love yourself. Love your enemies. Period. It is unconditional. So Sfiso Ncwane was never a good and an examplary Christian. He was never good at all and doesn&#8217;t represent Christianity. &#8220;I love him and some of his music. But when it comes to Christianity he has failed. You can say whatever you want but death must never be honoured. We are to set good examples when we are alive. Just imagine if he had reconciled with his mother and taken care of her, how many people in his same situation would have been inspired and compelled to do good just by looking at him?&#8221; In another Facebook post, he wrote: &#8220;Sfiso Ncwane was a good musician. I mean he has proved that. And also a good husband. But he was a bad son to his mother. He rejected her and she cried even in papers that he&#8217;d accused her of having tokoloshes and zombie; also when she had nothing in the fridge, he&#8217;d go buy an expensive car for his new pastor who&#8217;s super rich and leave his mother with nothing. &#8220;And when he was sick, I&#8217;m told he went to his mother to ask for a kidney and his mother sent him to the pastor. While we mourn, let&#8217;s all remember to never turn against our parents because of our wealth, richness, religion and so forth. Even the Bible says our blessing comes from respecting our mothers and fathers and that has a reward of long life. &#8220;Now Sfiso didn&#8217;t do that and he&#8217;s dead too soon. The mother he&#8217;s turned against was the only person who could have saved his life and he chose the pastor over her. There is no forgiveness for those who mistreat their mothers.&#8221;
