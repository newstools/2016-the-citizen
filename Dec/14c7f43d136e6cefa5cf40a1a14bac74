A police officer was shot dead on Wednesday while patrolling around Jeppe in central Johannesburg. Spokesperson Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said police officers were conducting vehicle and foot-patrols in the Jeppe policing area on Tuesday when they responded to an alert of a business robbery in progress at a plastic shop in the area. Sergeant Andries Mabena and two other officers went to the shop. They went into the shop, where they viewed CCTV footage, said Peters. The brigadier said police later spotted two men who matched the description of the suspects and a shootout ensued. Sergeant Mabena pursued the other suspect. This suspect fired shots at the sergeant, fatally wounding him on the left side of the upper chest, said Peters. Both suspects got away. Police said a manhunt was under way. Gauteng provincial commissioner Lieutenant-General De Lange condemned the senseless killing of the on-duty officer and appealed to members of the public who may have any information that could lead to the arrest of the suspects to come forward.
