A 25-year-old woman believed to be a tourist from India died when the driver of the car she was travelling in apparently lost control of the vehicle on the N1 near the Vanderbijlpark off-ramp on Saturday, Gauteng paramedics said. ER24 and government emergency medical services (EMS) attended to the accident and found the car had rolled onto the side of the road, ER24 spokeswoman Chitra Bodasing-Harduth said. The woman was laying near the vehicle. According to the driver and bystanders, the woman, who was the front passenger, was flung in the vehicle and was hanging from the safety belt out the window. The driver apparently unhooked the safety belt and placed the woman near the vehicle. Upon assessment by paramedics it was found that she sustained multiple injuries. Sadly there was nothing that could be done and she was declared dead. The driver sustained minor injuries. He was transported to hospital for further medical care. It is believed that the man and woman are from India, she said.
