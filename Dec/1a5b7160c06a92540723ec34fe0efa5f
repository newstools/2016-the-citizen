Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane said that although 2016 had been a year when the focus had been on South Africans differences, he did not believe that it was a true reflection of how far the country s people had come in building a united country. There are more among us who continuously work to ensure that our country s motto of Unity in Diversity is not merely a phrase but a call to build a non-sexist, non-racial and united country for all people, he said in a statement released on Friday. He said that the National Day of Reconciliation reminded South Africans that the story of their country was one that had many contradictions, but that despite the contradictions, different races, cultures, religions, sexes and languages all the country s people were South Africans fighting for the same country. The work of building a better South Africa can only be done when we realise that our differences do not divide us but bring us together and during the toughest of times we are better together, he said. He pointed to the August 3 local government elections as being an indication that South Africans favoured reconciliation and that those who used our differences to mobilise without articulating a clear message of hope and change were rejected in favour of a message that brought us together. He said the DA was well aware of the country s past and it was working tirelessly to bring life to the country s constitution to ensure that the country consisted of a society based on democratic values, social justice and fundamental human rights. He wished all South Africans a beautiful and reflective Day of Reconciliation. African News Agency (ANA)
