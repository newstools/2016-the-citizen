Chad le Clos shook off his Rio disappointment early Wednesday morning (SA time) with a victory in the 200m butterfly of the Short Course Swimming World Championships in Windsor, Canada. The South African was denied an Olympic title repeat in the 200m fly by US great Michael Phelps. But a storming finish saw him repeat as short course world champion in 1:48.76 &#8211; the third-fastest performance ever in a 25m pool. American Tom Shields, swimming in lane eight, led at the 150m mark but finished second in 1:49.50. Japan s Daiya Seto was third in 1:49.97. It don&#8217;t go all that swimmingly for Cameron van der Burgh. He failed to reach the 100m breaststroke final after only posting the ninth-fastest time and paid the price for a slow start out of the blocks. Van der Burgh has the opportunity to atone for that disappointment when he participates in the 50m breaststroke on Saturday.
