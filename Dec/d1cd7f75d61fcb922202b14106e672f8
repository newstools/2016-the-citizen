A South African female university student will be jetting off to the US for a six-month internship at Boeing, the world s largest aerospace company and leading manufacturer of commercial jetliners and defence, space and security systems. Mbalenhle Sekautu, a 25-year-old Master&#8217;s student in Strategic Marketing at the University of Witwatersrand (Wits), will be travelling to Boeing in Seattle, Washington, in January 2017. Boeing on Tuesday said it had selected two students from South Africa to join an elite group of international students for the internship at the company s facilities in the US. The International Business Internship Program (IBIP), which was launched in 2012, provides students with valuable exposure to the latest technological, business advances and thinking in a variety of disciplines relating to business operations, finance, marketing, strategy and the aviation industry. The other intern from South Africa is Keegan Moore, a 23-year-old Bachelor of Science Honours student in Design Engineering also at Wits. The students will be exposed to a range of business activities and work alongside Boeing employees in various fields. They will also have an opportunity to spend time with Boeing leaders, visit several of the company s factories and share their experience with other IBIP interns from around the world. The Boeing managing director for sub-Sahara Africa and director of commercial airplane sales for Africa, Miguel Santos, congratulated the students on their selection and wished them well. The students will be provided with US-based work experience that will prove extremely valuable when they return and invest their new skills to the benefit of South Africa, Santos said.
