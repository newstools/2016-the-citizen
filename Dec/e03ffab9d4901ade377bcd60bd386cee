A teenager is missing after he apparently got caught in a rip current at Wilderness on the Southern Cape coast on Saturday afternoon, the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) said. NSRI Wilderness duty crew were activated at about 4.30pm by the police and Western Cape government health emergency medical services (EMS) who were on the scene at Kleinkrantz where a 17-year-old male had reportedly gone missing in the surf after being swept out to sea by rip currents while swimming, NSRI Wilderness station commander Robert van Helsdingen said. The sea rescue craft Clemengold Rescuer was launched and the EMS/AMS Skymed rescue helicopter joined in the search. It appears that the teenager, from George, was at the beach with his sister when rip currents swept him out to sea while he was swimming. A bystander went into the surf to try to assist but according to reports he was not able to reach the teenager who had then disappeared under water. Despite an extensive sea, air, and shoreline search no sign of the teenager had been found and a police dive unit would continue with an ongoing search operation. Police had opened an investigation and were assisting the family of the missing man, Van Helsdingen said. African News Agency (ANA)
