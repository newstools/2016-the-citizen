Informal traders in Tshwane are accusing mayor Solly Msimanga of putting a stop to a bursary scheme for their children. Traders, under the umbrella body of the Tshwane Barekisi Forum, said they were very concerned about the mayor s attitude towards informal traders. The scheme currently benefits 104 children who are enrolled at tertiary institutions. Mary Ngema, secretary of the forum, said: The bursary scheme is to help the 104 finish their studies as well as for the incoming children from matric. Informal traders are key and significant players in the value chain of basic food and commodities. Our collective contribution towards the economy is very strategic and of significant importance. MMC for economic development Randall Williams said former Tshwane mayor Kgosientso Ramokgopa had promised the traders he would find the funds for the scheme, but he had not had a formal plan. Mayor Msimanga made a statement saying he can only do what is possible. The city is already in a R2 billion deficit, Williams said. The forum also handed over a memo to the city demanding the urgent registration of the market agent for informal traders, the release of distribution logistics and for election of informal traders leaders to be funded by the city.
