The Sharks will never surprise like the Bulls with pink of camouflage, but you can count on them being consistent. The Durbanites on Tuesday evening revealed customary black and white jerseys for next year&#8217;s Super Rugby campaign, which are typically simple and stylish. One interesting addition though is the distinct motif of the city of Durban and the Sharks being tightly intertwined. As a result, surfboards, Zulu shields and &#8211; naturally &#8211; sharks have been printed on the jerseys. Does that suggest the Sharks are moving to the Moses Mabhida Stadium soon?
