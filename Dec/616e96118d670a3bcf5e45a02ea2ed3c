Arsene Wenger&#8217;s side had hoped winning their group for the first time in five years would spare them a tie against one of the continent&#8217;s giants in the first knockout round, but instead they must face Carlo Ancelotti&#8217;s German champions, who came second in their section. Bayern eliminated Arsenal en route to winning the trophy in 2012/13 and repeated the feat a year later, while the teams also met in the group stage last season. PSG came second to Arsenal in Group A, leaving them vulnerable to a tough draw and five-time winners Barcelona have eliminated the French club in the quarter-finals in two of the past four seasons. Reigning European champions Real Madrid will face Napoli, while Pep Guardiola&#8217;s Manchester City face a testing two-legged encounter against Monaco. Premier League champions Leicester City will take on last season&#8217;s Europa League winners Sevilla, with Atletico Madrid drawn against Bayer Leverkusen, Juventus drawing FC Porto and Borussia Dortmund meeting Benfica. The first legs will be played on February 14, 15, 21 and 22 with the second legs on March 7, 8, 14 and 15.
