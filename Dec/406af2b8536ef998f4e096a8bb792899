In an extraordinary turn of events, the Springbok utility back Johan Goosen has called it quits. According to a statement published by his French club, Racing Metro, the former Cheetahs flyhalf informed management that he has been offered a job as a &#8220;commercial director&#8221; at a South African agricultural company. Goosen had been sending out strong signals of being unhappy at the club and told various sources he wanted to return home. The 24-year-old&#8217;s decision has made Racing very unhappy, especially after they had just signed him on an extended contract till 2020. However, it&#8217;s alleged Goosen signed a so-called CDI employment contract, which in theory means the playmaker had a &#8220;job for life&#8221; until he retires &#8211; hence his decision to stop playing. But French labour law is far more complex than that. The club also made a point of stating how much they had supported him in the past few years and would seek legal advice on the matter. Goosen was plucked out of the international wilderness by Bok coach Allister Coetzee in 2016&#8217;s international campaign but he wasn&#8217;t used effectively.
