Sanlam said on Monday that Dr Johan van Zyl would step up as non-independent non-executive chairman when Desmond Smith retires after the annual general meeting in June 2017. In an announcement to shareholders, the company said the board had unanimously nominated deputy chairman Patrice Motsepe to take over from Smith, but Motsepe had proposed the appointment of Dr Van Zyl. The company said Motsepe would stay on as deputy chairman. The statement added that Sipho Nkosi, who has served as an independent non-executive director since 2006, had been appointed lead independent non-executive director. Smith has served as chairman since 2010. Prior to joining the board in June 2009, he had been Sanlam s managing director from 1993, having joined the company in 1968. Van Zyl, who is chief executive officer of Ubuntu-Botho, as well joint chief executive of African Rainbow, is a former chief executive of Sanlam. He is credited with transforming Sanlam from a primarily South African life insurer to a multinational diversified financial services group during his tenure as chief executive. Commenting on behalf of the board on the appointment, Smith expressed confidence in the board s decision: Patrice was the board s choice but the board respects his decision and recommendation that Johan, a consummate leader, is well positioned to take over as chairman. His association with Sanlam and industry experience will add value to the future direction and growth of the company for the benefit of all stakeholders. The board has put in place well considered and adequate processes to uphold and safeguard adherence to good governance at all times. These include, among others, the appointment of Sipho as the lead independent non-executive director, he added. Further, Smith said, he anticipated a smooth handover from himself to the chairman-elect.
