The Blitzboks ended day one of the Dubai Sevens tournament unbeaten but there will a be a sense of unease after they narrowly beat the United States by 19-17. South Africa advance to the quarterfinals, where they will face either England or New Zealand, who still play each other Friday evening. This was a strange game in many respects. The scoreline felt superficially close, especially after Seabelo Senatla&#8217;s second try &#8211; an impressive sixth in three matches &#8211; opened up a nine-point lead with merely 60 seconds left. However, Perry Baker&#8217;s try after the siren was telling enough to leave observers wondering whether the US had missed out on a golden opportunity to claim the Blitzboks&#8217; scalp. Two of Madison Hughes&#8217; three conversions hit the upright and had he converted both, the Americans would&#8217;ve triumphed. South Africa will need to maintain their intensity if they are to progress in this tournament. There was already some evidence of them slacking off during the 21-5 win over Scotland. Senatla and the experienced Cecil Afrika&#8217;s tries in the first half we both beautifully rounded off, providing testament to the Blitzboks&#8217; ability on the attack. They generally defended well too but given the cut-and-thrust nature of the sevens game, that sometimes simply isn&#8217;t enough, especially when concentration levels fluctuate. More accomplished opponents will exploit that better than the US did. Point-scorers: Blitzboks 19 (14) &#8211; Tries: Seabelo Senatla (2), Cecil Afrika. Conversions: Branco du Preez (2). USA 17 (5) &#8211; Try: Perry Baker (2), Stephen Tomasin. Conversion: Madison Hughes.
