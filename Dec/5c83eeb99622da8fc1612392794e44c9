A grassroots-based consumer research body has called for the implementation of a 13th cheque for pensioners at year-end so as to help them meet the challenges of the following year. The KwaZulu-Natal-based Pietermaritzburg Agency for Community Social Action (Pacsa) suggested that there should be a general increase in pensions, but that government must also contemplate issuing a 13th check in December to enable pensioners to pay for children&#8217;s schooling, clothing and food. Pacsa director Mervyn Abrahams said over the last year pensioners informed the organisation that they used their grants to access &#8220;friendlier credit&#8221; to cover food shortfalls and avoid their families falling into punitive unsecure debt. &#8220;A 13th cheque for pensioners in a month which carries with it the hardest burden might allow pensioners to pay off some of the debt that has accumulated throughout the year,&#8221; Abrahams said. He said the extra money could help to purchase children&#8217;s stationery, books, clothes and shoes, while securing the first tranche of school fees and transport. &#8220;January is a long and horrible month and increasingly hard for families to navigate. The pension could provide a strategic intervention to allow families the scope to plan their finances better and wrestle greater control of the year ahead,&#8221; Abrahams said. He suggested that a 13th cheque of R1 510 would cost around R4.8 billion for old age pensioners, but that was nothing compared to the average compensation for South African CEOs of $7.14 million (R98.5 million) as per the recent Bloomberg Survey on the Global CEO Pay Index. Abrahams argued that funding the 13th cheque for pensioners was equivalent to the annual compensation of 48 CEOs. He said a 13th cheque for pensioners could begin to unlock possibilities for justice, humanity, equity and dignity. &#8220;It is time perhaps that we started looking at the harm that our wage inequality is causing and perhaps also how scandalous levels of individual wealth can start to be used positively to get us out of the socioeconomic mess we are in. &#8220;The extreme wealth gap is becoming increasingly unsustainable and is a huge barrier to South Africa&#8217;s ability to wrestle control of its socioeconomic future,&#8221; he said. &#8211; ericn@citizen.co.za
