Is Morne Morkel&#8217;s international career in terminal decline? It&#8217;s becoming an increasingly valid question to ask as the lanky Proteas quick continues to be missing in action. And at the weekend he was one of numerous South African players to be released by his Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise.

Kolkata are known for buying expensive talent and it is revealing that the franchise chose to ditch Morkel, rather than trying to see if he can recapture his former glory. In fact, it&#8217;s suggests they feel the 32-year-old fast bowler, who has taken 242 Test wickets, isn&#8217;t worth the risk anymore. Morkel was part of the Proteas squad that won November&#8217;s Test series against Australia but there were continual doubts over his match-fitness. He had only played one first-class game before the trip and didn&#8217;t get a look-in when Dale Steyn was injured after the first Test in Perth. Instead, the selectors chose &#8211; with much justification &#8211; that Kyle Abbott be Steyn&#8217;s replacement. Morkel hasn&#8217;t been included in the squad to face Sri Lanka because of a persistent back problem. He isn&#8217;t the only high-profile South African to lose his IPL contract. Steyn, his partner-in-crime, will also need to find a new home. Yet the Proteas&#8217; brilliant fast bowler, who only needs 5 wickets to become the side&#8217;s leading wicket-taker in Tests, had already indicated he wasn&#8217;t going to play in 2017&#8217;s tournament. Steyn recently had surgery on a troublesome shoulder and wants to be rested fully before South Africa&#8217;s tour to England in May.
