A suspect in Friday s farm murder at Thabazimbi in Limpopo is under police guard in hospital in Rustenburg in North West after apparently shooting himself in the head, police said. Emanating from the police s manhunt for the unknown suspects who attacked a farmer at Spitskop smallholding outside Thabazimbi yesterday [Friday], a major breakthrough was made today [Saturday], police said in a statement. On Saturday morning, information was received that the suspect in the case was seen around the Rustenburg area in North West. Police officers reacted swiftly, joined by the Rustenburg Flying Squad. When the suspect noticed that his vehicle was being followed by SA Police Service (SAPS) members, a high-speed chase ensued along the Sun City road. The suspect was cornered and pulled off the road; he allegedly then shot himself in the head with the firearm believed to have been used during the farm attack. The 25-year-old man was seriously wounded, and taken to hospital for medical treatment under police guard. The firearm was confiscated and investigations were continuing, the statement said. Earlier, police said a manhunt had been launched for those involved in the murder of farmer Bertie Cilliers, 54, who was on Friday found dead at the Spitskop smallholding. His son had apparently found his body on the kitchen floor at about 2pm. The farmer had sustained several gunshot wounds. Spent cartridges were found at the scene and at this stage it was not yet clear what was stolen from the house. The farmer s vehicle, a Ford Ranger bakkie, was found abandoned a few kilometers from the crime scene, police said. African News Agency (ANA)
