Three surfers have been commended by the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) for going to the rescue of a father and son who got into difficulty in the sea at Nahoon Beach in East London on Saturday evening. NSRI East London duty crew responded to Nahoon Beach soon after 7pm following reports of a drowning in progress, NSRI East London station commander Geoff McGregor said on Sunday. The SA Police Service and Dynamic ambulance services also responded. On arrival on the scene it was found that a father appeared to have gone into the water to help his son who was in difficulty. The father grew tired and got into difficulty himself. We believe that a local surfer, Brandon Flynn, may have assisted the son out of the water and then went back into the surf with his surfboard and was assisting the father to stay afloat; the father was at this stage suffering complete exhaustion and no longer able to help himself. Jordy Malherbe and his dad Andre, local surfers, had arrived on the beach and, seeing Brandon helping the casualty, they both launched their surfboards to go to help Brandon. On their arrival we believe that Jordy took over helping the casualty, bringing him safely to shore, and Andre assisted Brandon, who was by now also exhausted, to get to shore. Local surfers Brandon Flynn, Jordy Malherbe, and Andre Malherbe are commended for going to the assistance of the father and his son and managing to rescue them successfully averting a disaster at Nahoon Beach on Saturday. The father and his son were checked by paramedics but they required no further assistance, McGregor said. African News Agency (ANA)
