The Orangedene Golf Club in Tzaneen, Limpopo, was robbed on Monday evening at 6pm. Colleen Natorp told the Letaba Herald that the two robbers she saw were wearing police uniforms. She said they walked into the club house quite casually. &#8220;My parents were busy behind the bar counter. The next moment they aimed their weapons at us and screamed &#8216;fall down!&#8217; My parents immediately fell flat and they pressed their weapons to my parents&#8217; heads. I was thrown on the ground,&#8221; said Natorp. According to her, her mother, Issie, was hit in the face with one of the firearms and her father, the club owner, Emil, was hit twice on the back of the head. &#8220;My mother is the most traumatised. They fled with cash, jewellery, liquor and cellphones,&#8221; Natorp told the Letaba Herald. The losses are believed to be in the several thousands of rands. &#8220;The police were on the scene reasonably quickly.&#8221; Issie will be taken to Pretoria for further medical treatment, according to her daughter. &#8211; Caxton News Service For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
