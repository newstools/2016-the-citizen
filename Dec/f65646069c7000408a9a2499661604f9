Video footage has emerged showing a scuffle between police and a motorist who drew a knife as police tried to manhandle him. In the video, the man is being dragged by police when he pulls out a knife. One of the officers is then seen fleeing the scene. It remains unclear as to when and where the incident took place. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed the incident, saying the man with the knife was arguing with his female passenger over a man in another car. According to Mbele, the argument escalated and the man left his car carrying a knife, chased the female passenger and threatened the man in the other vehicle. A metro police bus as well as SAPS officers arrived on the scene. Mbele said the man was arrested and would appear in court on Wednesday for carrying a dangerous weapon.
