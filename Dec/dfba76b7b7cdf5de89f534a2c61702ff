President Jacob Zuma has declared Tuesday, December 27, 2016, a public holiday, the Presidency said on Monday. The decision was occasioned by the fact that this year workers in the country will only have 11 public holidays instead of 12 due to the fact that the 25th of December [Christmas Day] falls on a Sunday, the Presidency said. The Presidency said that according to section 2(1) of the Public Holidays Act, 1994, whenever a public holiday falls on a Sunday, the following Monday shall be a public holiday . It said because Monday was already another public holiday, the Day of Goodwill, it resulted in the two public holidays overlapping. The declaration of the 27th December as a public holiday will ensure that workers are not unduly disadvantaged because of this unusual event and are still entitled to their 12 paid public holidays.
