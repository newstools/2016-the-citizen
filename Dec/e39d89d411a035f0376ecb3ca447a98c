The Democratic Allience (DA) and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) councillors reportedly walked out of the eThekwini metro&#8217;s council meeting on Thursday over a decision by the ANC to have discussions relating to the posts of senior municipal managers to be held behind closed doors. At the centre of the protest by the opposition parties is the future of municipal manager Sibusiso Sithole who has been involved in a spat with mayor Zandile Gumede. The ANC wanted the meeting to be out of the view of the public eye, but the DA and EFF objected to this. On Wednesday, the DA alleged that Sithole was being forced out of his post for refusing to give in to the governing party&#8217;s demands to employ its cadres to the municipality.

He was reportedly told by Gumede to take leave until the end of the month, which he reportedly snubbed, citing municipal processes. However, the claims have been denied by the ANC with the municipality saying it would only comment on the matter following Thursday&#8217;s meeting. The metro&#8217;s powerful decision-making body, the Executive Committee (ExCo), which sends its resolutions to council for ratification, met behind closed doors today to discuss the senior managerial posts. A media briefing was expected to be held at 3pm by the municipality with Sithole and Gumede. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
