Turns out you were not the only one who cringed every time someone verbally butchered Porsche . Porsche themselves decided to clear the air by releasing a tutorial video which teaches those in need how to correctly pronounce their name. Have you ever wondered about the right way to pronounce Porsche? Or do you know someone who pronounces it in a wrong way? Be sure to let them know about this video , reads the description. It s not common (at all) for a company to do this sort of thing but we re guessing that someone in Porsche with a very good sense of humour will become responsible for finally making those misinformed people start saying Porsche the right way.
