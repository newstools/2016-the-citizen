Blessed as we are with our climate, South Africans are far more likely to celebrate the festive season in shorts than snowshoes and with a cold lager above a steaming spiced rum cup. But it is at this time of year that we should think deeply and meaningfully about where we have come from in the past 12 months and where we would like to be headed in the next. This season, when for the more fortunate majority the workday worries are replaced with ample leisure time, providing the respite the consciousness craves to plot a chart across the new year, it is also a time to sit back and enjoy the fruits of our year s labours. But equally, it should give pause to think about the plight of the less fortunate, whose dream of a braai bursting with delicacies will largely remain a mirage. There is little that most of us can do on an individual basis to alleviate the plight of the indigent, the unemployed, the hungry and the homeless. Even collectively, this is a task not lightly undertaken. But we do a disservice to those closest to us over the festive season if we do not, even briefly, acknowledge those in want.
