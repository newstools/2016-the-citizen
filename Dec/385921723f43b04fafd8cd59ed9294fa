The Brazil star was substituted just before Sergio Ramos&#8217;s dramatic late equaliser in El Clasico and had complained of pain in his right leg. &#8220;The FC Barcelona medical services conducted tests on Neymar this Monday morning and were able to confirm that the trouble he is feeling is due to muscle fatigue in the groin area,&#8221; the club said in a statement. &#8220;They also determined that there is no sign of any injury,&#8221; it added, with Neymar to undergo physiotherapy over the course of the next few days before returning to training. The 24-year-old is suspended for Tuesday&#8217;s final Champions League group game at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach as well as Saturday&#8217;s visit to Osasuna in La Liga.
