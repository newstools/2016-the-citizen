Two men, who tried to steal a luxury car worth more than half a million rand using fraudulent vehicle finance, appeared at Kimberley Magistrate s Court on Wednesday. The Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) spokesperson Captain Philani Nkwalase said they acted on information and intercepted a fraudulent vehicle purchase transaction at a prominent car dealer in Kimberley. Nkwalase said upon approval of an online vehicle finance application, four people came to collect the vehicle from the dealer on December 13. The original documents handed over during the finalisation of purchase were suspicious and the police were called. It was established that the identity of a Mr Mdluli was used for transaction, said Nkwalase. When they applicants came to collect the vehicle police were lying in wait. Shimi Danny Glaswin Mayaba was arrested while three other suspects fled the scene. Further investigation led to the arrest of Lawrence Ngcobo and Jeremiah Assembly Ngala in Gauteng December 20, said Nkwalase. Nkwalase said, Ngcobo and Ngala s court case was postponed for bail application. Ngcobo is also facing charges related to the possession of fraudulent documents. The fraudulent car deal matter will be back in court on December 29. African News Agency For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
