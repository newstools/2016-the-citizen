The police have over the past weekend arrested a total of 405 suspects for various crimes during an operation in the Uitenhage Cluster, Eastern Cape police said on Monday. These arrests included murder, assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm, robbery, fraud, house breaking and theft and the possession of suspected stolen goods, spokesperson Captain Gerda Swart said. Swart said several roadblocks were set up on different access and exit routes in the Uitenhage Cluster and resulted in the arrests of 29 people for driving while under the influence of alcohol. She said several liquor premises were also visited and 11 owners and managers received fines for non-compliance with the liquor act, while a total of 89 traffic fines were issued, valued at more than R44 500. Some of the suspects were arrested on charges relating to stock theft, contravention of a protection order, shoplifting and fraud, and 48 suspects were detained for the illegal possession of drugs. Swart said police in the Uitenhage Cluster would continue to combat crime effectively, especially over the festive season. We will continue our efforts and we will have a zero-tolerance approach, being tough on crime. African News Agency (ANA) For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
