Domestic cricket&#8217;s long and unsavoury match-fixing scandal has reached another important juncture but there&#8217;s still no end in sight. Alviro Petersen, former Proteas opening batsman, on Wednesday evening was handed a ban of two years by Cricket South Africa (CSA) for his involvement. However, Bernard Ngoepe, independent chairperson of CSA s anti-corruption unit and former Judge President of the North and South Gauteng High Courts, confirmed the investigation is not complete. &#8220;We are still finalizing certain aspects of the investigation and w e will not stop until we are fully satisfied that we have exhausted every lead and scrutinised every aspect relating to this matter,&#8221; he said in a statement. Despite admitting in March to being the whistleblower for the illegal activities of former team-mate Gulam Bodi, Petersen nonetheless accepted several charges of breaching CSA&#8217;s Anti-Corruption Code for Personnel. He admitted to four counts failing to disclose the details of approaches; four counts of not providing sufficient information to investigators and one count of concealing or destroying evidence. The 36-year-old is the fifth prominent domestic player to be implicated in the scandal after Thami Tsolekile, Jean Symes, Ethy Mbhalati and Pume Matshikwe were all handed bans between 7 and 12 years. Bodi, who was the middleman between the players and an Indian betting syndicate, was suspended for 20 years in January. However, it&#8217;s clear CSA&#8217;s anti-corruption unit couldn&#8217;t quite pinpoint what Petersen&#8217;s true intentions were. Petersen maintains he was merely &#8220;playing along&#8221; as to not arouse suspicion but several sources previously questioned whether the veteran merely flip-flopped after still meeting Bodi two days before he eventually alerted the relevant authorities. As a result, CSA has withdrawn charges relating to him actually intending to fix or influence matches as well accepting any bribes to do so. &#8220;Alviro has realised his mistakes and has acknowledged contravening the Code. He is obliged to have disclosed various approaches,&#8221; Haroon Lorgat, CSA&#8217;s chief executive, said in a statement. &#8220;While having provided certain information to the investigators he had also withheld and concealed certain material information, such as the meetings with Bodi and certain fixers. This was directly relevant to the investigation.&#8221; Petersen reiterated it was never his intention to fix but apologised for not reporting his meetings with Bodi and co. &#8220;At the time that the meetings with Bodi and the fixers happened, I never had any intention of fixing matches or taking money,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I now deeply regret having participated in these meetings and not to have immediately reported them to the authorities as I am obliged to do.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
