Dar es Salaam. The government should invest heavily in marketing, hospitality and infrastructure to boost tourism in the southern and western circuits after figures revealed that the total number of visitors in the two zones was more than eight times less compared to that of the northern circuit. Statistics from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism show that the southern and western circuits, with a total of nine national parks, received only 101,788 tourists compared to 805,420, who visited national parks in the northern zone in the year 2014/15. Such gap has been experienced for a while with minor improvements after cumulative numbers between 2008/09 and 2014/15 showed the two zones received a total of 600,591 visitors, just far behind by nine times of those visited the northern circuit with six national parks. The national parks in the southern and western tourism circuits are: Mikumi, Ruaha, Katavi, Saanane, Mahale, Gombe. Udzungwa, Rubondo and Kitulo. Poor performance of the zone has made the regions hosting the attractions - Kigoma, Katavi, Mwanza, Morogoro, Njombe and Iringa - to less benefit from tourism. The case with Arusha, Manyara, Kilimanjaro, Mara and Tanga, is completely the opposite. Tourism is the largest foreign exchange earner since 2012, contributing an average of $2 billion annually, which is equivalent to 25 per cent of all exchange earnings, according to the government data. It also contributes to more than 17 per cent of the national Gross Domestic Product (GPD) and creating more than 1.5 million jobs, 500,000 of which are direct.
