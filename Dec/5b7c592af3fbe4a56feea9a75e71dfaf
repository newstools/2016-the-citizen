The origin of the phrase lies, damn lies and statistics is itself a matter of conjecture; attributed by American writer Mark Twain to British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. But no matter the provenance, it gains new meaning in the data based on the latest quarterly employment statistics released by Stats SA, which show a miserly 0.9% growth between September 2015 and 2016. Minister of Finance Pravin Gordhan, talking to the national congress of the National Union of Metalworkers of SA, was moved to say SA was in the recovery ward and not at risk of recession, despite its slow economic growth. But the 93 000 jobs added during the June to September quarter had to be balanced against a revised decrease of 96 000 jobs between March and June. Still the figures provided show an estimated 9 282 000 jobs in the formal non-agricultural sector of the economy, up from 9 189 000. Average monthly employee earnings had increased by 4.4% to R543 billion in September. Perhaps this was easier in Disraeli s time and perhaps statistics were not as reliable but the bottom line is surely that the unemployed continue to grow.
