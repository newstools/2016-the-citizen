North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un is planning a &#8220;prime time&#8221; nuclear weapons push in 2017 to take advantage of leadership transitions in South Korea and the United States, a high-ranking defector said on Tuesday. In his first press conference since fleeing his post as North Korea&#8217;s deputy ambassador to Britain in August, Thae Yong-Ho said Kim had issued a directive at a rare ruling party congress in May to &#8220;complete&#8221; nuclear development by the end of next year. &#8220;With South Korea holding presidential elections and the US undergoing an administration transition, the North sees 2017 as the prime time for nuclear development,&#8221; Thae told local reporters. &#8220;That&#8217;s based on a calculation that the US and South Korea will not be able to take physical, military measures because they are tied up with domestic politics,&#8221; he added. North Korea carried out two nuclear tests in 2016 and numerous missile launches in pursuit of its ultimate goal of a deterrent capable of delivering a nuclear warhead to the US mainland. Analysts are divided as to how close Pyongyang is to realising that ambition, especially as it has never successfully tested an inter-continental ballistic missile. But all agree it has made enormous strides in that direction since Kim took over as leader from his father, Kim Jong-Il who died in December 2011. According to a transcript of his press conference, Thae said Kim would never trade away the North&#8217;s nuclear arsenal &#8212; no matter how large a financial incentive might be offered. The North Korean leader&#8217;s main aim is to open a new dialogue with the US from the position of a confirmed nuclear power, he said. Washington has repeatedly vowed that it would never accept the North as a nuclear state. Thae said he was ignorant of how much progress the North had really made with its nuclear weapons programme, saying such information was not given to diplomats. &#8220;Even the foreign minister doesn&#8217;t know,&#8221; he added. Thae was living in London when he escaped to the South with his wife and two sons &#8212; becoming one of the highest-ranking diplomats ever to defect. The North&#8217;s state media denounced him as &#8220;human scum&#8221;, and accused him of embezzling state funds, raping a minor and spying for South Korea in exchange for money. 1994-2016 Agence France-Presse
