Perhaps one of the more surprising submissions made at the national council of Umkhonto weSizwe Veterans in Johannesburg at the weekend came from Joel Netshitenzhe. A member of the ANC national executive committee and one of the ruling political party s leading strategists, Netshitenzhe said that candidates for senior leadership positions should be vetted in order to ensure the party protected its political and ideological identity. We would submit that this should have been a priority from the outset and that, as an addendum, the ability to make decisions for the greater good of this country s citizens the ANC does, after all, pride itself as being the party of the people be equally prioritised as a leadership requirement. We also back Netshitenzhe s contention that the ANC set up an electoral commission to do lifestyle audits on potential leadership candidates. This could go a long way toward the sleight of hand practiced by redeploying the elite. For as the unwelcome boils of hidden graft continue to bubble to the surface on an almost daily basis it is surely time for the ANC to back away from the bitterness and backbiting, which is today s public face of the movement. It is all very well for factions to harp on the collapse of trade union federation Cosatu and typify just how deeply the schisms in the union movement have hurt the ruling tripartite alliance. Equally, the noises emanating from the third pillar of the alliance, the South African Communist Party, about standing on their own feet in any future election something we further suggest they should have done from the outset of free elections reverberate disturbingly within the inner sanctum of Luthuli House. But in essence, we need less rhetoric, more reasoned leadership and real thought into the governance of this country. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
