You are probably in the majority as you are on holiday somewhere, hopefully sipping on a cocktail on the beach or enjoying the great outdoors. But I find it quite interesting that you are reading this column at this particular time of the year, on the 21st of December. This is the time when I trawl the internet for what the average person is reading on their phone, tablet or any other device they may have with them. I am talking about those Most read , Top read or What people are reading right now stories. We are about to wrap up the year and we have all had just about enough of the ups and downs of politics, the exhilarating moments in sports, as well as the ever-changing landscape of current affairs. We now consume junk status stories that seem to pique our curiosity. It turns out that while enjoying some downtime, we like to read about the most peripheral of stories. One of the most read stories circulating right now is called Six things your vagina wishes you knew . I assume that veejayjays are permanent fixtures on the fairer sex, so why would we only read up on this only at the end of the year? It is not like these body members are seasonal, where they magically pop up during the festive season? This is also a time when we tend to be a little less intelligent than we normally are. The entire year people have been reading about how the likes of Boity are always involved in bootcamps and other exercises to ensure they maintain the bodies they have, but now, we ask I wonder how they do it? Apparently a lot of people are reading a story entitled This is how Boity gets her incredible body! And then we think we can get the same body in a week or two I am not sure if it is the smell of turducken in the air or the sound of Ladysmith Black Mambazo s rendition of Little Drummer Boy that tends to change our preferences at the end of the year, but we also tend to be a whole lot more aspirational as well. All of a sudden people are clicking on website adverts selling houses for more than R2 million, knowing very well that your take home cannot even cover the rates and taxes of that area. But then again, if we do not do these things at this chilled time of the year, when can we do them? I am off to finish reading about those six things you know what wished I knew For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
