Keaton Jennings said scoring a century for England on his debut against India Thursday had been a dream come true after waking up a bag of nerves. I woke up at 5:00 am thinking I&#8217;d missed the bus so I jumped out of bed and panicked about where everything was, the 24-year-old told reporters after his knock of 112. But then I settled myself down when I saw the time. If someone had told me this morning that you&#8217;ve got a Test match hundred I would have bitten their arm off. It s been a dream come true, and just surreal that it s come on debut, Jennings added. Also read: Opportunity missed? Keaton Jennings scores 100 on England debut The South African-born opener guided England to a solid start of 288-5 in the first innings of their must-win fourth Test at Mumbai s Wankhede Stadium. The left-hander was almost caught while still to get off the mark and took until the 12th ball to get his first runs on the board, but when he did there was no stopping the tall opener. When the ball looped up to gully my heart was in my mouth and thought No you got a nought in your first innings&#8217;, but thankfully it went to ground and I went from there, he said. The 24-year-old hit 13 fours, including a trio of audacious reverse sweeps during his 219-ball stay. It was one of those sweeps that brought up his ton mid-way through the afternoon session, with Jennings raising his hand in delight. The emotion that went over me at that moment in time, the elation, the pride, the satisfaction to go to a test 100 was really incredible, really special, he said.
