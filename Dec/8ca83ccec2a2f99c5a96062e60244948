Tickets for his next visit to South Africa officially went on sale. Videos circulated of teenagers crying when finally handed their tickets. But why the fuss? Back in 2012 Lady Gaga broke the internet, when tickets for her The Born This Way Ball world tour went on sale. Computicket and Big Concerts decided to use an online queuing system to deal with the high demand but failed to realise the pop superstar could crash the system. They ended up having to use online and conventional systems. Since then, online selling has become more trusted, and easier and also instant. Instead of waiting in line, online retailing instantly lets you know if there are still tickets available. It s estimated that two-thirds of tickets for Bieber s Purpose Tour will have been bought online. This is also the first concert offering the public tickets to the value of R15 000. Top-tier tickets get Beliebers up close with the star in a special VIP pit next to the stage. The deal includes a pre-show backstage tour, invitation to the Purpose VIP Lounge, first entry into the exclusive pit and access to an on-site concierge. By late afternoon there were still limited tickets available. Tickets start at R410. During his 2013 Believe Tour Bieber filled the FNB Stadium to capacity. Citizen reporter
