Twitter was abuzz on Monday after a Twitter user posted a photo of a bill on which he and the person he was with appeared to be referred to as &#8220;2 BLACKS&#8221;. The restaurant/lounge in question is The Bungalow in Clifton, Cape Town. The photograph, taken by Scott Maqetuka, caused outrage and argument, and the restaurant referred The Citizen to The Kove Collection company&#8217;s head office where a staff member confirmed that they had been dealing with numerous queries about the matter all day. She said, however, that the customer had &#8220;misunderstood&#8221; what had happened and the matter was now &#8220;totally sorted out&#8221; and the customer was now &#8220;very happy&#8221;. She said they had not made any statements on social media about the matter because that was not company&#8217;s policy. However, we found this official statement about it on Twitter. They said their system normally used table numbers to identify customers. Calling the customers &#8220;two blacks&#8221;, they said, was the act of one employee and they were investigating it to ensure it did not happen again. .@Scott_Maq Our official response to the unfortunate incident over the weekend at The Bungalow. pic.twitter.com/c0mN4Y3Tll &mdash; The Kove Collection (@KoveCollection) December 19, 2016 The customer himself also seemed less than impressed, writing that he did not accept the apology. @KoveCollection I do not accept your apology. You&#39;ve failed to contact me directly as an offended patron. &mdash; Scott (@Scott_Maq) December 19, 2016 @KoveCollection I had to hear from a journalist on how you plan to handle this incident. No apology/communication to the offended patron. &mdash; Scott (@Scott_Maq) December 19, 2016 Here are some of the reactions from Twitter: @thesivu well if you want to spend R70 on watermelon then&#8230;hahaha!
