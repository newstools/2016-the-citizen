We do not condone fake social media accounts created under celebs&#8217; names, but sometimes, they&#8217;re all it takes to finally get them to open up about things their fans are curious about. Rapper Refiloe &#8216;Cassper Nyovest&#8217; Phoolo has been vocal about his crush on Minenhle Dlamini now, but it just never worked out for him, as she is now engaged to Quinton Jones. Fans were left wondering why it never worked out between them, besides the fact that she was with someone else, as Cassper had made his intentions known to the model, even in one of his songs. Now, a Twitter user has created a fake account under Cassper&#8217;s name and tweeted Minnie. &#8220;I want to be @MinnieDlamini&#8217;s second husband lol I love her so much,&#8221; the account tweeted. Without realising that the account was fake, Minnie responded, finally telling us why she won&#8217;t marry the Mama I Made It hitmaker. She said she could not marry Cassper because she did not want to be like Karabo Moroka, who at some point wanted to marry a second husband, as she fell in love with the man she was having an affair with. https://twitter.com/MinnieDlamini/status/812973397126905856 &#8220;You want to turn me into a real life Karabo from Generations. Merry Christmas Superstar,&#8221; she said. Minnie announced her engagement earlier this month, news that left Cassper devastated . Cassper said he was so distraught he did not want to talk to anyone and would be switching off his phone for the rest of the day. The sad part, apart from losing his crush, was that she got engaged only five days before his birthday. I m devastated!!! I don t want to talk to nobody!!! I m switching my phone off for the rest of the day!!! 5 days before my birthday bro. Read more: Cassper on Minnie s engagement: I m devastated! &nbsp;
