Standard Bank, the country s largest bank by number of customers, has increased the monthly fees of its two mid-market accounts. The pricing of Elite Banking (comparable to other banks gold accounts) will increase by 5% to R100 from January, while Prestige Banking (a platinum account) will jump by 6% to R190. These increases are broadly in line with inflation. While the minimum monthly service fee for those not on the bundled pricing options will remain flat (for both Elite and Prestige), 2017 will see the introduction of a monthly cheque card fee for both (R8.25 and R12.50, respectively). This means an effective increase of 15% for Elite accountholders and 13% for Prestige clients. The methodology for calculating fees on cash withdrawals will change from a flat fee plus 1.2% of the value to an amount per R100 drawn. So, for withdrawals at ATMs, the fees will compare as follows: Elite/Prestige Banking 2017 2016 Standard Bank ATM R1.80 per R100 R4 + 1.2% of value R100 withdrawal R1.80 R5.20 R500 withdrawal R9 R10 R1000 withdrawal R18 R16 R2000 withdrawal R36 R28 Other bank s ATM R6.70 + R1.80 per R100 R6.70 + R4 + 1.2% of value R100 withdrawal R8.50 R11.90 R500 withdrawal R15.70 R16.70 R1000 withdrawal R24.70 R22.70 R2000 withdrawal R42.70 R34.70 With the new pricing methodology, you are more incentivised to draw as little cash as possible from ATMs. Anything over R1000 will cost significantly more in 2017 than it does this year. For example, a R2000 withdrawal at a Standard Bank ATM jumps from R28 to R36 29%! The cost of (securing and transporting) cash is only increasing. Amazingly, Standard Bank customers on either the Elite or Prestige bundles still pay for debit orders (R4.50 for internal and R16 for external ones from next month (up 22%!)) and inter-account transfers to anything aside from a savings or investment account will cost R4 (from R3.90 currently). The fee for electronic account payments via internet/app/mobile banking also excluded reduces by 23% to R4 next year, the only notable reduction across its current account product set.

In other words, you will pay at least R63.25 for Elite Banking (R55 + R8.25) and R106.50 for Prestige Banking (R94 + R12.50). In the case of Prestige Banking, the only time it makes sense to be on the pay-as-you-transact plan if you require a credit card is if you don t withdraw or deposit cash often. Your base monthly fee will be R106.50 for the cheque account and R55 for the standalone credit card. This is cheaper than the R190 bundled fee, but not by much. Like Nedbank, and rivals, the monthly credit card fees will largely increase substantially. It s the gold account segment that will be hardest hit, with the gold credit card fee increasing by 29% to R45 per month. Prestige Banking customers on the bundle pricing option will not be affected as their Titanium credit cards are included in the overall account service fee (the fee for a stand-alone Titanium card is up 31%).
