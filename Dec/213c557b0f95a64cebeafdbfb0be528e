Police spokesperson Captain FC van Wyk said the Emergency Medical Services paramedics were robbed of their cellphones by two armed men while they were treating a patient in Mandela Park in Harare, Khayelitsha on Tuesday. Police followed up on a tip from the community the following day and arrested two 19-year-old suspects. Van Wyk said a toy gun believed to have been used in the robbery was also confiscated. Further investigation led to the arrest of a third perpetrator who was in possession of the stolen items he purchased from the perpetrators. The trio will appear in the Khayelitsha Magistrate&#8217;s Court on December 30 on charges of robbery with aggravating circumstances. African News Agency (ANA)
