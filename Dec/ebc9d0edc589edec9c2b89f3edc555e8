Vardy brought a halt to his 16-game barren run in spectacular fashion as the England international clinically converted all three of his shots at the King Power Stadium to net his first hat-trick for Leicester. It was also Vardy&#8217;s first treble since 2012 when he was playing for Fleetwood against Ebbsfleet in non-league football. Vardy&#8217;s life has changed hugely since then and asked if he could recall his previous hat-trick, the Premier League title winner said: &#8220;I&#8217;m guessing it was for Fleetwood, against Ebbsfleet? I think I scored an audacious halfway line shot as well.&#8221; Vardy is now Leicester&#8217;s all-time leading Premier League scorer as his 34 goals took him ahead of Emile Heskey. But the 29-year-old, who departed to a standing ovation when he was substituted in the closing stages, was more concerned with the impact his goals could have on Leicester after a disappointing run had seen them fall dangerously close to the relegation zone. &#8220;You can definitely say that. We wanted to make sure we were competitive and see the team fighting for the cause and we definitely showed that,&#8221; Vardy said. &#8220;We will just get back on the training pitch and look forward to the next game.&#8221;
