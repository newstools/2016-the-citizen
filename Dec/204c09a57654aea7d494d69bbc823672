According to Sunday Sun, a visibly upset Gugu said she was not allowed to be with her mother, Fikile, Sfiso&#8217;s wife Ayanda and their two sons in the VIP area. Instead, they were told to sit with everybody else while celebrities and influential people comforted Ayanda. Gugu and her relatives decided to leave the stadium and wait outside. &#8220;We went to the airport to receive Sfiso&#8217;s body, along with Ayanda. But when we arrived at Moses Mabhida, marshals told us we weren&#8217;t allowed to sit with Ayanda. Even when we explained that we were close family members, they insisted we should sit with the general public,&#8221; said Gugu.

I&#8217;m leaving and wish my mum could join us. It&#8217;s clear that some people don&#8217;t want us here,&#8221; said Gugu. This comes after Sfiso&#8217;s mother, Fikile said she wouldn&#8217;t be attending his memorial in Durban last week as they lived too far and requests to have it moved closer were not considered.
