It seems American artists are finally listening to our good local hip-hop music, according to what has been happening on Twitter. Kiernan &#8216;AKA&#8217; Forbes has taken to Twitter to comment on Bruno Mars&#8217; new hit song 24K Magic, suggesting that he stole his &#8220;sh*t&#8221;. &#8220;Bruno Mars straight up bit my shit,&#8221; he said, adding a laughing emoji at the end, meaning he was not exactly making a big deal out of it. Compare the two songs below: And AKA&#8217;s One Time: While AKA&#8217;s was released earlier this year, Bruno Mars released his in October. Some of his followers agreed with AKA, saying Bruno Mars&#8217; new song sounded like One Time. &#8220;Actually noticed that a while back, the beats literally sound very similar, especially when it starts its easy to confuse the two,&#8221; said one of his followers. Another just suggested that AKA sue him and call Wendy Williams to expose Bruno Mars. Those who disagreed also noted that AKA was not taking it seriously. https://twitter.com/akaworldwide/status/807966799958593536 &#8220;Relax the sound is not the same and AKA was kidding man, this just means they actually dig the same music,&#8221; said one of his followers. At least Americans are not coming at him with all they have like they did with Cassper Nyovest when he was accused of stealing Kanye West&#8217;s stage setting. A few weeks back, Kanye West went on a rant during his Saint Pablo Tour about someone stealing his original idea of a floating stage. In a video he posted on Instagram, he said: This the original. Accept no imitations. You with the rap God right now. Niggas be copying my sh*t bro. Stealin our sh*t, stealin stages. Copying our sh*t one-to-one #KanyeWest in Edmonton. This left most thinking he was talking about Cassper Nyovest, who had a floating stage last year during his Fill Up The Dome concert.
