A woman has caused a social media stir after she shared pictures of herself following allegedly being physically abused by her husband. &#8220;Today I break the silence,&#8221; wrote Yolo Pityana in a Facebook post in which she shared pictures of her body with bruises. She says that she&#8217;s been abused by her man, who she says has been abusing her for more than two years. Pityana says she has prayed and forgiven her spouse after he abused her, but his behaviour had not changed. &#8220;I have been beaten, and cheated on and abused for the past 2 years by my husband. Women love does not hurt and only God will complete you. &#8220;I prayed, I forgave, I gave 2nd, 3rd and many chances for him to change. However, the pain never stopped. &#8220;Ladies. Love like you never been hurt before, but most of all love yourself more, not to stay longer than the first time. Leave leave leave. &#8220;This has been the best example of my life on how God speaks and we decide to ignore that voice that says NO&#8230; &#8220;Ladies listen to the inner voice.&#8221; Yolo Pityana Yolo Pityana Yolo Pityana Yolo Pityana Yolo Pityana Yolo Pityana Yolo Pityana Yolo Pityana After being given a lot of support on social media, Pityana returned to thank all those who had supported her. She posted on Facebook: &#8220;I would like to share my gratitude to everyone at large. It humbles me to receive such support. It has indeed been fully appreciated. I may not know some of you by name, however i would sincerely like to share my appreciation. &#8220;To those who may have different feelings towards showing any support towards my pain or my reasons for even sharing the post. To you too I say thank you because the reason why we are different is to share different views too, however let me also mention one thing you may forget in the process, I have a girl child whom if i do not give an impacting reason to say NO to abuse, She may find any reason to say YES to abuse. &#8220;This is to all women, girls or vice versa as it may uniquely apply to you, STAND and say it is ENOUGH, if not for you, for generations to come.&#8221;
