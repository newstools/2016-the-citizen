The mayor of Mogale City, west of Johannesburg, on Thursday tendered her resignation effective immediately due to ill health . In a statement, Democratic Alliance (DA) leader in Gauteng, John Moodey, said the party noted with sadness that councillor Lynn Pannall had resigned. Councillor Pannall took over the reins of the city following the August local government elections with enthusiasm, commitment and a rarely seen dedication to getting the job done, Moodey said. Unfortunately ill health forced the Executive Mayor to cut back on her busy schedule and has now reached the point where it would be detrimental to both her health and the office of the mayor for her to continue in this position.

Mogale City was one of the hung municipalities in Gauteng after the African National Congress (ANC) won 48.84 percent of the vote, while the DA won 34.88 percent, the EFF 11.65 percent and the FF Plus 2.29 percent. The ANC won the the speaker position after the IFP split its vote during the first sitting of the new council, voting with the DA for mayor and ANC for speaker. Moodey said the DA would now call on the Speaker to urgently convene a special council meeting to elect a new mayor and ensure that the work started by Pannall and her team was able to continue without delay.
