Quinton de Kock&#8217;s reputation as one of the rising stars of world cricket was confirmed on Thursday. The exciting Proteas wicketkeeper was named the International Cricket Council&#8217;s (ICC) one-day cricketer of the year. In the voting period, the 24-year-old left-hander scored 793 runs in 16 ODIs with four centuries and a half-century. Also read: Alviro Petersen handed 2-year ban but he&#8217;s no match fixer He averaged over 56 and held a strike-rate of just under 98. With the gloves, De Kock dismissed 15 batsmen behind the wickets. It s great to hear that I ve been named. To be named as the best from among so many good cricketers gives one utmost satisfaction,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This award obviously rewards consistent performances at the top level and I m happy to have done well for my team over this period. To join a select group of players that includes AB de Villiers makes this a special moment, one that I ll cherish for long.&#8221; De Kock, together with De Villiers, Kagiso Rabada and Imran Tahir were named in the ICC&#8217;s one-day team of the year. Despite an injury-riddled 2016, Dale Steyn still did enough to earn the nod for the Test team of the year. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
