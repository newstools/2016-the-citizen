The fifth annual South African Hip Hop Awards were broadcast on MTV Base South on Monday night and fans are really not impressed with almost everything that went down. The awards, which took place two weeks ago at the Lyric Theatre, Gold Reef City, saw rapper Cassper Nyovest walk away with five awards, including Most Valuable Artist. The awards trended on Twitter for most of the night, with fans questioning why they were even aired on TV in the first place when the production was still &#8220;trashy&#8221;. &#8220;The South African hip hop awards should have never have been broadcasted they were absolutely trash the the production was sh*t #SAHHA2016,&#8221; wrote one fan. Most said the stage setting reminded them of high school prize-giving ceremonies, further calling on the department of arts and culture to invest in the awards. Others questioned how A-Reece won Lyricist of the Year over Nasty C, who has been commended for his content as a young artist. These were some of the comments on Twitter: Still makes no sense on how A-Reece won lyricist of the year over Nasty. #SAHHA2016 pic.twitter.com/TiFlOFwqni &mdash; Dvpper Twin.
