Armed with the inspiration to lend a helping hand through science, two Grade 10 St Stithians Girls&#8217; College pupils have ended their 2016 schooling year with the knowledge that their work could soon touch people&#8217;s lives. Zabanguni Phakathi and Alexia Galatis designed an ultrasonic proximity detector belt, which they dubbed as the &#8220;See Me&#8221; belt, which uses electromagnetic waves to detect the obstacles in its surroundings horizontally from the sensor and at lower angles. The pupils described how the sensor within the belt worked the same way that a sensor in a car worked while reversing and beeps if an object is detected. &#8220;The belt contains a switch that can be turnt on and off when needed and has a 12 voltage battery that should last just over a day when using it often, it then needs to be recharged,&#8221; described the pupils. Phakathi and Galatis have exhibited the belt at a number of expos this year and clinched gold at the Johannesburg regional Eskom Expo for Young Scientists before going through to the selections for the Eskom Expo for Young Scientists International Science Fair 2016, where they achieved a silver medal. Their senior science teacher at the Girls&#8217; College, Elana Shaw, said: &#8220;The girls did a fantastic project. It showed originality, and the girls went the extra mile.&#8221; Shaw explained that the pupils designed the belt as part of a science project to test any scientific idea or existing problem. &#8220;The girls worked very hard on their project and took quite a complex idea and made it into something that could benefit lots of people,&#8221; said Shaw. This is just what Phakathi and Galatis set out to achieve, saying they wanted their project to be of &#8220;great use&#8221; and to help visually impaired people to navigate their surroundings with ease. It is not only teachers and the expo judges who saw potential in the belt, as the Guide-Dogs Association South Africa also found the pupils&#8217; initiative &#8220;absolutely inspiring&#8221;. This is according to the association&#8217;s head of public relations, Pieter van Niekerk, who explained that the pupils contacted the College of Orientation and Mobility at the association, which is responsible for long cane training. Van Niekerk added the belt would &#8220;be of assistance with or without the long cane used by visually impaired persons&#8221;. Van Niekerk added: &#8220;Michele Huma and one or two of our orientation and mobility practitioner students had an opportunity to evaluate the belt, whereafter myself, as a visually impaired person, was requested to test it out.&#8221; He said he was not aware of any similar electronic devices, apart from a prototype handheld device that the college tested a few years ago, the Mini Guide, and the UltraCane. He added the pupils were in discussion with an engineer involved with the design to add vibration impulses and how to detect stairs and holes. &#8220;I would love to test-drive the upgraded prototype,&#8221; he exclaimed. The pupils said the association gave them good advice to consider. &#8220;They assisted us by giving us more information about the lifestyle of the visually impaired. They liked the idea of the belt and they gave us many ways in which the belt can be improved,&#8221; they said, adding they would like to improve the belt in many ways and that &#8220;this is only the start of a working process&#8221;. &#8220;We would like to see a production of the belts happen, and we would like to experience the belt making a difference in many different communities in which it can be sold,&#8221; the pupils explained. Communications coordinator for St Stithians College, Lethabo-Thabo Royds, expressed how proud the school was of the pupils. &#8220;Zaba and Alexia, through this initiative, are living out our strategic intent; they are inspiring excellence and making a world of difference.&#8221; Zabanguni Phakathi and Alexia Galatis of St Stithians Girls&#8217; College designed this ultrasonic proximity belt to assist visually impaired people to see.
