Just in time for Christmas, Rocking the Daisies has released 500 limited festive season early bird tickets for the 2017 festival. Next year, the festival will once again take place at the Cloof Wine Estate, Darling. The festival has become an important calendar marker, thanks to its status as an eco event. The green goals of Rocking the Daisies are an integral part of the festival as it developed over in recent years. A full, comprehensive eco audit is performed each year and is undertaken by an independent organisation Steadfast Greening. The festival aims to be as close to a carbon-neutral event as possible by reducing where possible any carbon expended in the production of the festival. Pre-release tickets to the festival are available for R750. But it s not just Rocking the Diaises spreading festive cheer. OppiKoppi have opened their Krismis Tix. At R750 per ticket, the price includes either a free T-shirt or a R100 cashless card voucher to spend at the festival. The 2017 general tickets will cost between R850 to R950. The R750 tickets are limited to 1 000 people. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
