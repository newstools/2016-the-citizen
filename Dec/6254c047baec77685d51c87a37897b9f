English cricket simply can&#8217;t get by without a South African it would seem. Keaton Jennings, the 24-year-old son of former Proteas coach Ray, had tongues wagging on Thursday when he made a century on Test debut against India in Mumbai. The left-hander, a former captain of South Africa&#8217;s national u-19 side, was almost caught early on and took 12 balls to score his first run. Thereafter, he enjoyed himself and brought up his century with a brilliant reverse sweep. At tea on day one, Jennings was on an unbeaten 103.

It would be unfair to blame local administrators. Curiously, Jennings is the first England batsman to score a hundred on debut since 2009. The last man? Another South African, Jonathan Trott. Made in South Africa, Michael! https://t.co/MBk4GFniVY &mdash; KP (@KP24) December 8, 2016 https://twitter.com/jacqueskallis75/status/806779396358946817 Brilliant Brilliant 100 @JetJennings &#8230; Make them well Up North &#8230; !!!!
