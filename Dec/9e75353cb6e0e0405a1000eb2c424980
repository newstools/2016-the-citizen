Engelbrecht described how her son, Elrich, was on his way to write an exam at the University of Pretoria&#8217;s Mamelodi campus on Tuesday morning when he was involved in a hit-and-run accident on his motorbike. &#8220;A taxi driver tried to corner the red CITI Golf as it sped away while several other taxis cordoned off Elrich to prevent any vehicles from accidentally riding into the accident scene,&#8221; wrote Engelbrecht. She further described how a Tshwane paramedic disembarked from a taxi to assist her son and called an ambulance. He further accompanied Elrich to Life Wilgers Hospital. &#8220;An unknown student called Francois, also on his way to write an exam, stopped and, after getting my cell number, called to inform me about the accident,&#8221; wrote Engelbrecht, and she described how the student stayed with the bike for over an hour until it was collected. &#8220;None of my son&#8217;s belongings were stolen from him and after several hours in theatre to insert steel pins into his open femur fracture and repair other multiple injuries, he is alive and safe,&#8221; Engelbrecht continued, adding that she extended her &#8220;deepest gratitude&#8221; to the student, the taxi drivers, Tshwane paramedics and Metro police, saying they demonstrated that &#8220;we are a great nation of caring people&#8221;. &#8220;I salute each of you,&#8221; she concluded.
