Sri Lanka&#8217;s tour match against a South African Invitational XI in Potchefstroom predictably petered out on Tuesday. After restricting the hosts to 289 all out early on the final day, they opted for batting practice as they ended on 212/5 in their second innings before a draw was called. However, there wouldn&#8217;t be too much complaints from Angelo Mathews and his side as the Islanders managed to complete most of their objectives. The first of three Tests between the Proteas and Sri Lanka starts on December 26 in Port Elizabeth. Armed with a lead of 84, Sri Lanka decided to switch their batting order around. Also read: Leus du Plooy looks a star as he pastes Sri Lanka&#8217;s attack Kusal Perera and Upul Tharanga were sent in to open the innings after both failed in the first effort. The 31-year-old Tharanga will be particularly pleased with his 50 off 77 deliveries as he&#8217;s expected to provide experience in a brittle middle-order. Perera also retired after reaching a more sedate 50. Another key man, Dinesh Chandimal, provided the most vivid fireworks on a flat pitch as he made 60 off merely 52 balls. Encouragingly, he played crisp strokes instead of slogging. Captain Mathews, who&#8217;s under pressure to speedily become match fit, built on a decent bowling with a fluent knock. He seemed well set on 37 before he became one of Bjorn Fortuin&#8217;s two victims. When the left-arm spinner from the Highveld Lions had Kusal Mendis caught behind shortly afterwards, the teams decided to shake hands. Earlier, Nuwan Pradeep&#8217;s haul of 3/41 illustrated his inconsistent nature but it was 19-year-old seamer Lahiru Kumara that impressed most. He took 3/36 and certainly wouldn&#8217;t look out of place on South Africa&#8217;s seamer-friendly wickets. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
