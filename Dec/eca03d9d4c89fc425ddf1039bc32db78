When Mark Boucher was a 21-year-old rookie, it took him only two matches to make his mark in Test cricket. Typically, it&#8217;s taken him only slightly more than three months to reach his first final as a coach &#8211; Friday&#8217;s domestic T20 final against the Warriors. Yet the Titans mentor, whose gig at the franchise is his first ever, admits he&#8217;s had it a bit easier than many of his counterparts. This team has, after all, been the most consistent in franchise cricket for years and boasts a solid core of senior players. &#8220;The most successful teams I was privileged enough to play in were the ones where the team sort of ran itself,&#8221; said Boucher, a legendary Proteas wicketkeeper. &#8220;It&#8217;s no different in this dressing room. There are numerous players here who have won a lot of trophies. &#8220;They are very experienced and they lead the side. It&#8217;s no use only having one captain in Albie Morkel, you need a couple of others who can play leadership roles.&#8221; Also read: Titans give glimpse of transformation done right However, the Titans don&#8217;t merely boast many senior players. They have big personalities in their side like Morkel, Farhaan Behardien, Heino Kuhn and David Wiese &#8211; all Proteas. A rookie coach could easily be overrun. But Boucher, despite his inexperience, is in a unique position. Quite a few of his players actually played with or against him. &#8220;That helps. It means there&#8217;s mutual respect between us,&#8221; said Boucher. &#8220;I resolved that I wanted to be a coach that players would like to have. In fact, I want to be a coach that I would&#8217;ve respected as a player. &#8220;I&#8217;ve tried to do that and so far it&#8217;s gone nicely.&#8221; Combative and competitive as a player, Boucher isn&#8217;t nervous going into Friday evening&#8217;s climax in Centurion. &#8220;I&#8217;m feeling fine,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There&#8217;s only so much I can do. I&#8217;m pretty pleased with our preparations.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
