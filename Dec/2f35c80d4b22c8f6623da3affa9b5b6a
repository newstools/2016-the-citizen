Jordy Smith, South Africa&#8217;s leading surfer, finally broke his duck in Hawaii after winning the Vans World Cup early on Monday. The 28-year-old Durbanite admitted to &#8220;trying to win this title my whole career&#8221; but decided to place less pressure on himself in 2016&#8217;s edition. It clearly worked a treat as he finished above Portugal&#8217;s Frederico Morais and local favourite Torrey Meister to move into the third position of this year&#8217;s world rankings. Smith&#8217;s 2016 has been a good one as he also boasts winning the Hurley Pro in California earlier in the campaign. &nbsp;
