The North West hawks have shut down 20 illegal gambling sites last week followed by 10 more additional sites in various towns around the North West during the termination of Project Gremlin. This led to the arrest of 10 suspects. Hawks Captain Tlangelani Rikhotso said the intelligence-driven investigations pointed to locations in Klerksdorp, Vryburg, Potchefstroom and Schweizer-Reneke, where a total of 281 slot machines worth about R10 million were seized. The Hawks also confiscated 198 computers worth about R3.9 million and a lot of money. Head of the Hawks Lieutenant-General Mthandazo &#8216;Berning&#8217; Ntlemeza applauded the investigation team. Illegal gambling is costing South Africa millions in tax revenue, therefore having dismantled this many gambling sites is a job exceptionally done by the Hawks members, he said. Ntlemeza issued a stern warning to people from other provinces who are embroiled in this illegal network. The chips are down, and it s only a matter of time before we invade your town, he warned.
