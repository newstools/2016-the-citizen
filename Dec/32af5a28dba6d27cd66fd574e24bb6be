When North West beat Western Province in a thrilling provincial three-day game on Saturday, Andre Malan and his youngest brother Janneman didn&#8217;t feel bad consigning their eldest sibling Pieter and the Capetonians to defeat. In fact, he felt the game was more of a Malan family triumph than anything else. Also read: It&#8217;s a Malan family feast at Newlands After all, the three brothers created a unique piece of cricketing history by each scoring a hundred on the same day of cricket. Pieter started the talented trio&#8217;s domination with an unbeaten 117, before Janneman (135) and Andre (103*) guided North West to victory after they needed to score 351 to win in a mere 74 overs. &#8220;There&#8217;s actually never been much sibling rivalry between us three,&#8221; said Andre, the 25-year-old middle brother, on Sunday. &#8220;Naturally we&#8217;re competitive when we play with or against each other, but we were always taught to respect each other and our achievements.&#8221; The Malan brothers&#8217; imprint on this game shouldn&#8217;t really come as a surprise. These three batters were blooded at a very young age. &#8220;When we were living in Mbombela, our dad built us a cricket net,&#8221; said Andre. &#8220;He did so because the pitch he tried to cultivate didn&#8217;t work all that well. We played too much on it and it didn&#8217;t last. &#8220;Our net lasted longer.&#8221; Even during his downtime, Malan snr. had to indulge his sons&#8217; cricket habit. &#8220;He would go lie down on his bed for a bit but we would follow him. He would have to throw us balls and we&#8217;d practice our fielding in the bedroom. He never got rid of us,&#8221; said Andre with a chuckle. Pieter (27) and Janneman (20) were both key members of their respective South Africa Under-19 sides, while Andre achieved his breakthrough last season when he played in the domestic T20 for the Highveld Lions. All three are stalwarts at semi-pro provincial level and remain on the fringes of selection for their franchise sides. Andre admits he&#8217;s always a bit anxious when his brothers stride on to a field. &#8220;I won&#8217;t say it&#8217;s weird with and against your brothers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I&#8217;m very often a bit stressed about them. For example, when I play against Pieter, I hope we take everybody else&#8217;s wicket. I want him to do well. &#8220;It&#8217;s the same when I&#8217;m batting with Janneman. He&#8217;s my little brother, he should be prospering. We&#8217;re very tight.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
