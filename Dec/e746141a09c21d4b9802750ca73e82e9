This old woman&#8217;s relationship advice will leave you thinking twice about the kind of a relationship you&#8217;re in and if there is a future for it. In a video posted on Facebook by UNILAD, her first bit of advice was: &#8220;Be friends first.&#8221; You should talk about politics, religion, families and children so you know what they like to find out if you have things in common. &#8220;Talk about things that you intellectually agree with,&#8221; she said, because once you&#8217;re sexually attracted to someone, you don&#8217;t think about what they like. You don&#8217;t think about their mother possibly being a drug addict or if there is a disease in the family. &#8220;You&#8217;re not thinking about those things, you&#8217;re wrapped up in sex and you can&#8217;t think when you&#8217;re like that.&#8221; She further urges people to know what kind of person they&#8217;re into so they can go to places that cater for them. &#8220;If you like to read books or write poetry, go to a poetry club; go to libraries where you find people that are like-minded like you.&#8221; If it works out and they say they want to marry you, she says it&#8217;s still not a good reason for you to start kissing and &#8220;doing all that&#8221;. &#8220;Lock it down,&#8221; she says. &#8220;If you wanna marry me, let&#8217;s plan on a wedding; let&#8217;s have an engagement. Let&#8217;s make sure he has a job. &#8220;Find out what his financial [situation is]; if he is smart enough to know how to save money. &#8220;Find out if he&#8217;s a spendthrift and are you a spendthrift?&#8221; These are the things she says people argue about, she says. &#8220;After the good sex, what are you going to talk about? What do you have in common?&#8221; Of course, this advice is not a one-size-fits-all matter, as relationships are different and people want different things. However, for those who would like to know if they are in a relationship or a sexship, this woman may offer something for you to chew on. Watch the full video below:
