The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) held a memorial service for late Cuban president Fidel Castro in Soweto on Thursday. Taking to the podium, the party&#8217;s CIC, Julius Malema, had a lot to say about Castro, the African National Congress (ANC) and its president Jacob Zuma. Hailing Castro, Malema said if it were not for Castro, most African countries would still not be liberated today. He further said that if it were not for him, former president Nelson Mandela would not have been released from prison in 1990. He commended Castro&#8217;s leadership in Cuba, saying it was he who made the country one of the best in Africa. &#8220;In Cuba, only 3% are not employed, 99% are literate, life expectancy is 79%. We look up to Cuba! &#8220;In Cuba there is no youth loitering on the streets because education is expensive! We want to be like Cuba! &#8220;In Cuba, there&#8217;s a doctor for each group of 153 people! In Cuba, higher education is free! We want to be like Cuba!&#8221; This, according to Malema, has not been the case with South Africa. The elderly fear going to hospitals because they are like mortuaries. &#8220;We go to hospital to die, not live.&#8221; #Malema: MaNtuli did not use poison, she used &#39;Korobela&#39; but put an overdose! #EFFOnCastro &mdash; EFF Official Account (@EFFSouthAfrica) December 1, 2016 He further slammed the ANC government, saying they had no right to celebrate Castro&#8217;s life, as they sold out the principles he fought for. Castro had a problem with a government that benefited the elite and the families of those in power, he said. &#8220;In SA we have leaders who steal rhino horns! That is gangsterism! That&#8217;s what Fidel Castro was fighting in Cuba! &#8220;Who is Blade Nzimande? Why is he commemorating the memory of Castro when he refuses to give students free education?&#8221; he asked. He further slated Zuma, saying the two presidents should not even be compared. #Malema: America attempted to kill Castro 600 times. Zuma&#39;s wife attempted to kill Zuma once! There&#39;s no comparison. #EFFOnCastro &mdash; EFF Official Account (@EFFSouthAfrica) December 1, 2016 While America attempted to kill Castro 600 times, Zuma&#8217;s wife, Nompumelelo Ntuli-Zuma, had only allegedly attempted to kill Zuma once, he said. According to Malema, however, it may have been accidental because she had only been using korobela (love potion) to keep Zuma infatuated with her. But he says she used way too much of the stuff. &#8220;MaNtuli did not use poison, she used &#8216;Korobela&#8217; but put an overdose!&#8221; Zuma reportedly made claims a few days ago that he had been poisoned three times by people who wanted to get rid of him. Castro passed away on Friday aged 90.
