The African National Congress in the Western Cape will lay a complaint of racism with the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) against a Cape Town woman for making racist remarks on Facebook. Vanessa Hartley, a resident of Hout Bay, has written an offensive Facebook post which says They are like stupid animals. We should tie them to a rope. Too many Africans flocking to Hout Bay. Draw up a petition. Soon there will be nothing left of Hout Bay , the ANC said in a statement on Sunday. As the ANC in the Western Cape, we refuse to accept that this province is tragically bound to the evil of racism that the brotherhood that should be the mosaic of this province can never be realised. We reject Vanessa Hartley s racist rants as both a distorted view of what this country is about and certainly not representing the majority of our people in this province. Racists will not have the final word. We request that the South African Human Rights Commission apply maximum punitive and corrective measures within their domain to ensure that this kind of behaviour is rejected and abandoned, the statement said.
