The Nigerian army has defeated Boko Haram in the Sambisa forest, one of the jihadists&#8217; last remaining strongholds, President Muhammadu Buhari said Saturday. A campaign lasting for months in the 1,300 square-kilometre forest in northeastern Borno state led to the &#8220;final crushing of Boko Haram terrorists in their last enclave in Sambisa Forest&#8221; on Friday, Buhari said in a statement. He congratulated his troops for &#8220;finally entering and crushing the remnants of the Boko Haram insurgents at &#8216;Camp Zero&#8217;, which is located deep within the heart of Sambisa Forest&#8221;. &#8220;The terrorists are on the run, and no longer have a place to hide. I urge you to maintain the tempo by pursuing them and bringing them to justice,&#8221; he said. The statement made no mention of the whereabouts of Abubakar Shekau, the leader of the Boko Haram faction based in the forest. ola-cl/jh/kjl 1994-2016 Agence France-Presse
