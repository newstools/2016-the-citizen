The death of award-winning gospel musician Sfiso Ncwane has left his followers and peers shocked. It is believed Ncwane, 37, died of kidney failure at a Johannesburg hospital early on Monday morning. Respected gospel artist Vicky Vilakazi said she last saw Ncwane at the Crown Gospel Music Awards a week ago. He looked healthy. This is shocking, it is better if you could have seen someone looking frail, but he was far from that state, Vilakazi said. He was okay. I wish I can go back to that moment [when I saw him] to say goodbye. Vilakazi and Ncwane were to perform at the Rustenburg Carnival Festival at Olympia Park on December 17.

But now I understand why he did not submit. I received the news about his death while I was in a meeting discussing the gig. I m still shocked. I don t believe that Sfiso is dead. Friend and owner of Oluchi Media, Siya Mtolo, said: It is sad because no one gets used to death. It is shocking, especially when it involves someone young, who has a wife and little kids. He lived his purpose to the fullest. He really loved his wife. And he was humble. Ncwane s wife, Ayanda, and family spokesperson, friend and award-winning gospel musician Sipho Makhabane both could not be reached for comment. The Democratic Alliance in KwaZulu-Natal and Pan Africanist Congress of Azania conveyed their condolences. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
