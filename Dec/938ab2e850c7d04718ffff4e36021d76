The past few months have been the worst for Kaizer Chiefs fans, who it is safe to say have forgotten what winning a match feels like. In anger, fans have been pleading with the football club&#8217;s boss, Kaizer Motaung, to sack his coach, Steve Komphela. The lost matches have been blamed on the coach, with most saying fans hardly understand what he is saying because of his &#8220;dictionary English&#8221;. Even the EFF&#8217;s Floyd Shivambu has complained about the coach, calling for the Soweto giants to hire a coach who &#8220;understands what he&#8217;s saying&#8221;. However, Minister of Sport and Recreation Fikile Mbalula has previously pleaded with fans to allow Motaung to do what is best for the team, even if it means keeping the coach they want sacked. Mbalula said it was not always the coach to blame for the losses, but also some players play badly to sabotage the coach if they do not like him. At the time, fans disagreed with him, saying he had no right to comment on Chiefs matters as he was not a fan. In fact, Mbalula only wanted the coach to stay so that he could make fun of the team after its losses. Well, fans were right. Chiefs lost 3-1 to Chippa United and the minister took to Twitter to make fun of the team, intensifying calls from fans for Komphela to be sacked. The minister shared a picture of Chiefs fans looking rather traumatised, with one female fan crying hysterically. &#8220;So much trauma in one picture,&#8221; wrote the minister.

Some have started blaming the club&#8217;s boss for &#8220;failing to listen to the fans&#8221;. They have likened the situation at Chiefs to that of the ANC. Voters have been calling for President Jacob Zuma to step down, while MPs always defend and keep him in his position. &#8220;ANC people shouting for Kompela&#8217;s resignation while they&#8217;re stacked with Zuma [sic],&#8221; said one of his followers, while another called the ANC NEC and Chiefs management &#8220;cowards&#8221;. &#8220;Kaizer Chiefs management is exactly as the @MYANC NEC, all cowards!
