By taming the All Blacks 14-7 in an absorbing semifinal of the Cape Town Sevens on Sunday, the Blitzboks not only made sure of a showpiece match against England (kick-off at 19:44). Far more importantly, they proved New Zealand rugby doesn&#8217;t have a stranglehold over South Africa when it comes to the sevens format. This was, after all, a second consecutive victory over the old enemy after beating them 40-0 in Dubai last week. The Blitzboks&#8217; triumph may come at a price though. Seabelo Senatla, South Africa&#8217;s try-machine, had come into the game carrying a calf niggle and despite setting up Branco du Preez&#8217;s try, he was replaced at half-time. Another stalwart, Kyle Brown, had to be taken off the field with a golf cart after injuring his right knee try to compete at a breakdown. Yet the Blitzboks&#8217; bench has been the envy of many sides in this tournament and it showed its teeth once again. With the game deadlocked at 7-all, replacement Rosco Speckman scored a spectacular, match-winning try after running 75m from a lineout. His brilliant contribution made the All Blacks panic and thereafter they found themselves being frustrated by typically solid South African defending. Point-scorers: Blitzboks (7) &#8211; Tries: Branco du Preez, Rosco Speckman. Conversions: Cecil Afrika, Du Preez. All Blacks (7) &#8211; Try: Sherwin Stowers. Conversion: Rocky Khan.
