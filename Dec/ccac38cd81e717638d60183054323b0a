Apart from the newly launched Opel Astra being the Wesbank South African Guild of Motoring Journalists Car of the Year finalist, the 11th-generation Astra has scooped two overall victories and a category win at the 7th Independent Motoring&#8217;s annual awards. The Opel Astra grabbed the trophy for Overall Best of the Best award and Best Family Car award at the 7th Independent Motoring&#8217;s annual Best of the Best awards in Johannesburg. Motoring journalists from Independent Group were able to asses more than 60 new cars, bakkies and SUVs launched in South Africa over the past 12 months. The judges rated the Astra highly for its sophistication, ride quality and good value for money. They also pointed out that it incorporated advanced driver-assistance technologies that have traditionally been the preserve of more expensive luxury cars. Opel has upped its game with a car that s lighter yet roomier, more interesting to look at, classier inside and packed with new-age gadgets, said Independent Media&#8217;s motoring editor Denis Droppa. In standing out against a market of overachievers, the new Astra has done it by ditching some mass in its midriff and gaining some in its cranium. The 11th-generation Astra is no stranger to being feted by motoring experts and is the reigning European Car of the Year. It is also a finalist in the Wesbank South African Guild of Motoring Journalists Car of the Year competition. Efficiency is the Opel Astra s middle name and with a combination of a lighter and athletic design, improved aerodynamics and powerful yet frugal engines have resulted in a car, which is exceptionally affordable to run without sacrificing driving enjoyment.
