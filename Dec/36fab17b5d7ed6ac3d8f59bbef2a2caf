The Congress of the People (Cope) on Thursday accused President Jacob Zuma of insulting ANC stalwarts and members of the party&#8217;s highest decision-making body, the national executive committee (NEC), by claiming that &#8220;white monopoly capital&#8221; was behind calls for him to be removed from office. &#8220;This is a very serious insult to well-respected stalwarts such as Professor Ben Turok, former minister of intelligence Ronnie Kasrils and Mavuso Msimang. It is also an insult to his own ANC NEC members who had tabled a vote of no confidence in him at the last NEC meeting,&#8221; Cope said in a statement. Following a raft of scandals that have dogged his presidency &#8211; the latest being the controversial State of Capture report compiled by former public protector Thuli Madonsela &#8211; numerous ANC stalwarts, including some NEC members, have previously called for Zuma to step down. On Wednesday, Zuma told about 2 000 people attending an ANC Youth League &#8220;economic freedom&#8221; lecture in Durban that he had heard news reports about an international business chamber calling for his resignation. Speaking in his capacity as ANC leader, he said he didn t owe anyone an explanation for his decisions.

He used his address to pose a question to his audience, asking: What is it that I have done wrong? Cope spokesperson Dennis Bloem has condemned the comments as irresponsible, saying Zuma must tell the country and his own party if all the ANC veterans and ordinary card-carrying members and supporters who called for his resignation are part of &#8220;white monopoly capital&#8221;. &#8220;It is very clear to us that Zuma just opens his mouth without thinking. He is not only insulting the political fraternity but the broader society. The majority of society is sick and tired of him. Is Zuma saying the religious leaders who called on him to step down are also part of white monopoly capital?&#8221; Bloem asked. He said Zuma must accept that his time in power was up and he must not try to defend the indefensible by blaming white monopoly capital for his &#8220;misjudgments&#8221;. The party also reminded Zuma that former SABC board chairperson Mbulaheni Maguvhe had also refused to resign, but did so on Monday. &#8220;Where is he now? He is gone. Zuma will go, whether he likes it or not.&#8221; For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
