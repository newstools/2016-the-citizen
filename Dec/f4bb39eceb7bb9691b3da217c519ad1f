Reports this week that cricketers could be red-carded and even ejected from the ground from the end of next year is good news. The world cricket committee of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), the guardian of the game s laws, this week recommended that a player should be removed from the field for threatening an umpire, physical assault or any other act of violence. Violence in sport is a big no-no, and strict measures need to be put in place to make sure it doesn t spoil the game. It looks as though these measures will affect club cricket more than the professionals, but by implementing such sanctions it certainly sends out the right message, whether you are playing a Sunday lower-league club game or in the World Cup final. There was a survey done of the umpires and 40% said they are considering giving up the game or giving up umpiring because of verbal abuse, former England captain and current MCC committee chairperson Mike Brearley said. The umpires have to be respected and given the best possible chance and I think cricket is the only game in which there isn t this possibility of an in-match punishment or deterrent. The powers that be must make sure they apply the sanctions wisely. For as much as the game needs order, you definitely don t want to rob cricket of its colourful characters.
