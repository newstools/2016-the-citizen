We are saddened by the misguided arrogance displayed by SABC wunderkind , Hlaudi Motsoeneng, in an address delivered to the ANC Youth League in Durban. Motsoeneng, one of the prime targets of attack by witnesses offering testimony before the parliamentary commission on governance at the public broadcaster before the House of Assembly went into recess until the end of January, appears completely unmoved by the reported chaos left behind in the corridors of power, or by the repeated slights on his management style during his time at the SABC. His assertion that young people should emulate him in being radical when demanding transformation and job opportunities really demands some further examination.

We would also suggest that this is not dependent on a matric certificate alone. Motsoeneng s galactic rise from his position as an obscure producer at regional radio station Lesedi FM to the prime power broker within the corporation is, it could be argued, graphic proof that his method does have some efficacy. But pushing yourself to the front of the line at the expense of others, arguably more qualified and at unseemly outlay from the public purse is not an unqualified certainty for a successful formula. More than anything right now, the continued existence of the SABC needs calm and reasoned logic to get it back on track and plot a way forward that firmly closes the door on past excesses and the damage left behind in a troubled wake. But what it does not need are the empty echoes of the voices of a failed corporate revolution. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
