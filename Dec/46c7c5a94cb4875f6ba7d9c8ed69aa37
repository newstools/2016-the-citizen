Activist Noluvo Swelindawo&#8217;s body was found near the N2 highway in Driftsands, near Khayelitsha, with a gunshot wound in an alleged hate crime. The 22-year-old activist was well-known in her community as an active member of the Sikhumbule Safe Space group, raising awareness campaigns and holding workshops in schools on gender-based matters, The Daily Vox reports. Sikhumbule&#8217;s friend, Luzuko Mnukwa, and a fellow member of the group told the publication she had no doubt her friend was murdered because she was a lesbian. She further said Sikhumbule was targeted because whoever killed her, allegedly 10 men, went to her house and took her from there. She said the community believed they knew who the culprits were but would not confirm anything until the investigation was over. Western Cape police spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana confirmed that the deceased sustained a gunshot wound to her body. No one had been arrested yet, as police were still investigating the matter.
