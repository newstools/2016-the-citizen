Poet and musician Ntsiki Mazwai has had a moment of apparent insight about comedian Trevor Noah and his jokes. In a series of tweets on Tuesday morning, the poet likened Noah to fellow comedian Leon Schuster, whose jokes have long been criticised for allegedly being racist. According to Mazwai, the two comedians are the same in that they make jokes about black people and their accents. &#8220;Kahle kahle Trevor Noah is like Leon Schuster&#8230;.he makes jokes out of blacks and their accents&#8230;.kahle kahle,&#8221; she said. https://twitter.com/ntsikimazwai/status/813635068728066048 She said she had never heard him make &#8220;derogatory&#8221; jokes about white people, a comment that some of her followers disagreed with. &#8220;He makes jokes about everyone from what I&#8217;ve seen, I don&#8217;t see how that&#8217;s a problem,&#8221; said one of her followers. Another said they had heard him &#8220;joke about white Americans, white Australians and the British in their own countries&#8221;. Though she agreed with the comments, she said the jokes he made about whites were not derogatory. Some said he had every right to make jokes about black people as he was also black. Mazwai agreed with the follower, adding that Noah was black, &#8220;with a touch of white privilege&#8221;. Mazwai has previously criticised The Daily Show host for pronouncing black names in an English accent. &#8220;Someone please tell Trevor Noah not to pronounce black names in English&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;lol! nicely though&#8230;even Apartheid is now apartheight,&#8221; she said on Twitter. She has, however, also commended the comedian for representing us well as a host on the American show. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
