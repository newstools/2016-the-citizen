The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) on Thursday welcomed the appointment of Matshela Koko as an acting group chief executive of Eskom. In a statement, NUM spokesperson Livhuwani Mammburu said Koko had gained a lot of experience within the company since he joined Eskom as an engineer and would be able to steer Eskom in the right direction with his experience. We call upon Mr Koko to continue with an implementation of income differentials that seeks to dismantle and bury unjustified race and gender income disparities that are still prevalent 22 years after the dismantling of apartheid, Mammburu said. The NUM advice to the Acting GCE is that he must always consider all stakeholders when making decisions, in particular, trade unions.

Koko was the head of generation at Eskom after he joined the power utility in 1996 as an engineer-in-training and moved steadily up the ranks. As the head of generation, Koko holds executive responsibility for coal procurement. His appointment follows the resignation of group chief executive Brian Molefe earlier this month, following his implication in former public protector Thuli Madonsela s State of Capture report. The Democratic Alliance (DA) lashed out at the decision to appoint Koko, saying that this was recycling the same personnel after the State of Capture report found that the Eskom board was improperly appointed .
