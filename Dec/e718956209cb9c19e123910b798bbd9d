The average water levels for dams in the Western Cape had fallen to below 50%, the MEC for Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning said on Wednesday. MEC Anton Bredell said the latest figures from the National Department of Water and Sanitation showed that the overall level for dams in the province had dropped from 51.45% last week to 49.81% this week. In a statement, Bredell said: There are large numbers of visitors to the Western Cape for the holiday season that add to the demand for water. We would caution the public to assist us in using water responsibly. Bredell s department has spent a week in the Central Karoo district, driving a water awareness campaign. The Central Karoo remains one of the worst affected areas in the Western Cape, he said. Department officials went to the region last week to provide information and create water savings awareness for the region and to visitors passing through via the N1. This program will continue in the West Coast early in the new year. According to Bredell, the water situation in the Western Cape was not yet a crisis, despite five areas having been declared disaster areas over the past year. We are constantly monitoring the situation and municipalities are implementing additional measures, including restrictions and tariff increases where necessary.
