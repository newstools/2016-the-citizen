Parliament has rejected a City Press article on the Secretary To Parliament (STP) as &#8220;sensational and misleading&#8221;. The article, Parly&#8217;s big spender describes the costs which STP, Gengezi Mgidlana allegedly racked up on business trips, including an R44 320 bill for being &#8220;chauffeur-driven in a Mercedes-Benz&#8221; and a R14 050-per-night hotel stay in London. City Press reports that this spending is despite an outcry from opposition Members of Parliament earlier this year. Parliament described the article as rehashing a series of old articles, to which it said it had responded &#8220;comprehensively&#8221;. Parliament said the situation was compounded by &#8220;the apparent personal targeting of the STP&#8221;. It said that the article&#8217;s insinuations of the STP&#8217;s wrongdoing or law-breaking were baseless. &#8220;Indicators are to the effect that the City Press journalist on this crusade, derives personal joy at vilifying the STP at all costs up to a point of selective morality and negation of basic facts provided,&#8221; said Parliament. In the City Press article, Parliament s new media manager, Manelisi Wolela is quoted as defending the STP&#8217;s expenditure on the trips, saying, as a strategic imperative as the fifth democratic Parliament is saddled with a responsibility of repositioning Parliament from its first-generation achievements and challenges, and to relaunch itself on to a new development trajectory for the second generation . Wolela was further quoted as saying that the strategic interventions, which are a bid to reposition Parliament, could not be sacrificed, even in a cost-cutting context. Parliament&#8217;s statement issued on Sunday read, &#8220;Parliament sees the series of articles as efforts aimed at denigrating the standing of the STP, hoping to derail the programme of remodelling and repositioning this institution to be able to lead good governance from the front, as it has begun turning the corner with a clean audit finding by the Auditor General. We therefore reject these articles as sensational and misleading, and should be rejected with the contempt they deserve.&#8221; Parliament said the report ignored facts and was selective in portraying the costs of official trips to Parliament&#8217;s international partners as very high and without taking exchange rates into consideration. Parliament gave an example of how a basic hotel accommodation service would cost R1 300 for bed-and-breakfast for South African civil servants, however, it could cost about R23 000 per day in London. &#8220;The policies are clear with regards to transport and accommodation services the STP, as the accounting officer of Parliament, is entitled to nationally and internationally. Regarding the provision of chauffer services in the country, this was done in line with the applicable policies and regulations,&#8221; read the statement. &#8220;Parliament is determined to sustain its constructive and principled labour relation management approach, which would withstand the negative tone carried in one of union leaders rather irresponsible utterances. Issues other leaders are commenting on are literally being revived from the grave-site, as they were raised in the Joint Standing Committee of Parliament and the secretariat dealt with and closed them.&#8221; Parliament said &#8220;a culture of entitlement to bonuses&#8221; had permeated every unit of the institution for many years and needed to be confronted and corrected through leadership and management. &#8220;Parliament strongly believes that attempts to derail efforts to improve the performance outputs and outcomes of Parliament through, among others, tightening financial management, strengthening of performance based and results driven management of staff, and improving overall efficiencies of this institution, is bound to fail.&#8221; It said that delivering better services to Members of Parliament and the people needed to be done while striving for excellence. &#8220;We will always reiterate that an institution that achieves 46% of its performance targets, has no basis to grant bonuses willy nilly. Of course this decisive and correct stance taken by the management of Parliament, is being explained and managed in a series of engagements with the employees and their representative union.&#8221; More news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
