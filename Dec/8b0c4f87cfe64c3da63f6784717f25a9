Captain Nkosikho Mzuku said police also confiscated two firearms during the intelligence driven operation. Police pounced on the suspects in the early hours of Monday morning and confiscated two 9mm pistols, a pellet-gun, 15 rounds of ammunition and stolen cellphones. Mzuku said two suspects were charged with illegal possession of firearms and the other three were charged with possession of suspected stolen goods. One of the suspects is a Somalian national. Mzuku said the firearms will be sent for ballistic tests, to establish if they had been used in any criminal act. The five men are expected to appear in the Mdantsane Magistrates&#8217; Court on Tuesday. -African News Agency For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
