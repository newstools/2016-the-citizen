More than anyone, Paul Harris knows how hard it is to be the Proteas&#8217; frontline spinner in Test cricket, especially in local conditions. Yet the former tweaker believes fellow left-armer Keshav Maharaj is the &#8220;ideal candidate&#8221; to spearhead South Africa&#8217;s spin bowling for the foreseeable future. And the 26-year-old from Durban will have an early opportunity to showcase that ability when the Proteas kick-off their Test series against Sri Lanka in Port Elizabeth on Monday.

Faf du Plessis loses his appeal &#8220;St George&#8217;s Park is known for being spinner-friendly,&#8221; said Harris, who took 103 wickets in 37 Tests. &#8220;It&#8217;s obviously not going to be a raging turner but Keshav will gradually come into his own as the Test progresses.&#8221; Maharaj was unexpectedly called up for the Proteas&#8217; successful tour to Australia and impressed with the way he fitted in so easily. &#8220;He was really superb on Test debut in Perth,&#8221; said Harris. &#8220;Not every rookie spinner bowls on the bouncy Waca pitch and takes 3/56. You can&#8217;t underestimate how much he contributed to the Proteas&#8217; turnaround in that match.&#8221; The national selectors were clearly so chuffed with his progress that they&#8217;ve selected him as the only specialist spinner for the first two of three Tests. &#8220;That&#8217;s saying a lot because I doubt South Africa will play four seamers. &#8220;Keshav has been picked because the selectors feel he&#8217;s the best local spinner in the country and only want to use him,&#8221; said Harris. Despite wrist spinners like Imran Tahir, who remains the Proteas kingpin in ODIs, and Tabraiz Shamsi create more excitement, Maharaj has an underrated strength. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen Keshav play quite a lot and even played against him. &#8220;He&#8217;s not a flashy bowler,&#8221; said Harris. &#8220;But that&#8217;s not what makes him a good player. He&#8217;s consistent and reliable. That counts for more in South Africa.&#8221; Harris points to the troubles Tahir experienced during his disappointing Test career as ammunition for his argument.

Keshav&#8217;s biggest improvement is his control.&#8221; That versatility should help Maharaj trump his more experienced and celebrated direct opponent, 38-year-old Rangana Herath. &#8220;He&#8217;s a world-class, wily campainer,&#8221; said Harris. &#8220;It will be interesting to see how he adapts on South Africa&#8217;s seamer-friendly pitches but he&#8217;s had success here before. &#8220;Keshav knows how to bowl on green local surfaces. He&#8217;ll need take advantage of that.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter. &nbsp;
