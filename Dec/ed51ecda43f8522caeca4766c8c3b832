It is not beyond the bounds of reason to equate our battered economy with an overladen credit card; for that is essentially how the Treasury manages to keep the country ticking over and paying its bills. This is the inference the average person in the street must surely draw from Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan s reply to a parliamentary question by the DA s David Maynier on South Africa s debt-to-GDP ratio. This, we would hazard, is in many ways an inexact method of judging whether we can indeed pay the bills; debt is a living reality. GDP encompasses all monies earned anywhere in this country which, at last count, stood at a shade under R3.5 trillion. In the wake of the junk status scare South Africa has endured, it emerges that R468 billion is owed to the people of this country in sureties to prop up dysfunctional entities like Eskom and South African Airways. Much of this debt will be used on essentials like wage bills and running expenses rather than infrastructure and future investment. To those of us citizens not comfortable with the minefields of macroeconomics, it would seem we are living beyond our means. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
