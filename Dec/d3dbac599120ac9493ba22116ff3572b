Thirty-three children have been transported to various hospitals in Johannesburg for further assessment after they inhaled what is believed to be fumes of pool acid at the Zoo Lake Swimming Pool on Saturday afternoon, paramedics said. Following the incident patients were moved to a road close by and the parking area. However, [they] were moved to an undercover area when it started raining, ER24 spokeswoman Chitra Bodasing-Harduth said. At this stage, children are still in minor condition having reported difficulty in breathing. Children attended to by ER24 are believed to be between the ages of six and about 16, she said. ER24 had multiple vehicles on the scene and various other services were also in attendance. It is understood that the children inhaled toxic fumes of pool acid that was poured in the water. Investigations would have to be conducted to determine the exact cause of the incident, Bodasing-Harduth said. Netcare 911 spokesperson Athlenda Mathe said the children were aged between five and 18. Reports from the scene indicated that the children showed symptoms of respiratory distress. Police and the Johannesburg fire department also assisted on the scene.
