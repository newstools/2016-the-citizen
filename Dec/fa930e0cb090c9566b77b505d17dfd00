Economic Freedom Fighters CIC Julius Malema will not be entertaining the ANC Women&#8217;s League&#8217;s &#8220;nonsensical&#8221; utterances. According to the party&#8217;s Twitter account, Malema, who closed &#8220;the busiest political year with a bang&#8221;, is too busy enjoying the festive season with his family and the people of Seshego, and the league will not get in the way of that. Not even the party itself would respond to such &#8220;nonsense&#8221;. #EFF: Thus, he will not be entertaining any media enquiries regarding the ANCWL nonsensical utterances, n neither will EFF. (2) #EFFonANCWL &mdash; EFF Official Account (@EFFSouthAfrica) December 27, 2016 In a long statement released on Monday, the league lashed out at the EFF leader over comments he reportedly made against African Union Commission chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma at a dinner after the launch of his party&#8217;s election manifesto. He allegedly said Dlamini-Zuma was worse, further alleging that her security personnel said &#8220;she frequented the Gupta house like she had her own room&#8221;. Malema allegedly said Dlamini-Zuma would be no better than President Jacob Zuma should she become the next president. He further alleged that the president wanted his ex-wife and mother of his children to succeed him in order for the Zuma legacy to continue. According to the league, Malema&#8217;s narrative portrays Dlamini-Zuma &#8220;as nothing else but a person who is at the mercy of President Zuma with no capacity to lead&#8221;. It also &#8220;reduces women to be living under the shadows of males and in dire need of blessings from males to ascend to positions of power.&#8221; Malema had further displayed the highest level in undermining women&#8217;s capabilities to lead, which it said were &#8220;views from a patriarchist of high note.&#8221; ALSO READ: Malema&#8217;s Nkosazana allegations are &#8216;patriarchist&#8217; The league said Malema was just bitter because he had been expelled from the ANC and it showed every time he was given a microphone. &#8220;His bitterness has driven him to take all the EFF votes and put DA in power. His politics revolve around President Zuma and he will soon become irrelevant when President Zuma&#8217;s term as ANC president ends in 2017 and as state president ends in 2019.&#8221; The league has been vocal about the country being ready for a female president, throwing its weight behind Dlamini-Zuma. Like any member if the ANC &#8220;in good standing&#8221;, nothing prohibits her to be elected to serve in any structure of the ANC, they have declared. &#8220;She is a tried-and-tested cadre of the movement who is currently serving as a member of the ANC NEC and ANCWL NEC. However, &#8220;Only the ANC structures will be eligible to take decisions in term of who must lead the ANC,&#8221; it said.
