A family were tied up and robbed by four suspects on their farm outside the town of Ngodwana, in Mpumalanga province, in the early hours of Friday morning, reports the Lowvelder. Bossies Community Justice s Albert Gryvenstein received a call at about 3.30am that a family had been attacked on their farm. Gryvenstein said the suspects had cut the fence and had used a pick to wrench the door open of the house. The family were woken up by four men standing over their beds pointing firearms at them, he said. The suspects tied them up and ransacked the house, taking TVs and opened the safe and took their firearms. They filled their white Ford Ranger and fled the scene, he said. The father managed to untie himself and run to the nearest house for help. Hi-Tech Security Nelspruit s Response Manager, Callum Mac Pherson, said they received a call at about 10am from a farmer who lived on the Mataffin Road on the Kaapsehoop side. The farmer informed us about a vehicle which was abandoned in the area, he said. On investigation they found that the vehicle was the same Ford Ranger which had been stolen in the farm attack. None of the other items were recovered. Gryvenstein said the family had not been injured in the attack, but were traumatised from the ordeal. Caxton News Service
