In a torrid year for South African rugby, the Blitzboks provided a glimmer of hope on Satruday after winning the Dubai leg of the new World Sevens Series campaign. They defeated a misfiring Fiji by 26-14. The hallmark of this triumph was how South Africa built their assault on &#8220;unfashionable&#8221; fundamentals. They were relentless on defence and bullied the Fiji runners, who were guilty of loitering when they had possession. South Africa dominated, as was the case in their other two knockout games, the breakdowns and stood up well in the collisions against opponents who were far bigger than them. Fiji will also be disappointed with some substandard handling, which meant they never really had any momentum. A sweeping move shortly after the kick-off &#8211; featuring brilliant interplay between Seabelo Senatla and Cecil Afrika &#8211; saw the latter exploit the openside to put the Blitzboks on the board. Moments later, Branco du Preez cleverly took a quick tap from a scrum free-kick and showed superb strength to scythe through a lacklustre Fiji defence. The Islanders hit back just before the break with a sweeping move on the counter that was rounded off by captain Osea Kolinisau before seemingly being in the driving seat after scoring immediately after the restart. But the South Africans were simply too organised and disciplined as Chris Dry and Seabelo Senatla, who was named Player of the Tournament, sealed the win. Phillip Snyman, the Blitzboks&#8217; captain, believes the side&#8217;s success was down to peaking at the right time. &#8220;We were building steadily towards this,&#8221; he said afterwards. &#8220;We had some difficult moments on day one, but we improved gradually. I&#8217;m really proud of this guys, but we need to maintain our focus. We want to improve on this campaign when the Cape Town tournament starts next week.&#8221; Point-scorers: Blitzboks (14) &#8211; Tries: Cecil Afrika, Branco du Preez, Chris Dry, Seabelo Senatla.
