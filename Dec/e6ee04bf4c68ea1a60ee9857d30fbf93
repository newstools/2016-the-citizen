Knysna Municipality has issued an urgent appeal to residents and visitors in the Greater Knysna area to use water sparingly. In a statement on Tuesday, the municipality said consumption in the week of the 5 to 12 December was extremely high , with residents using 14.3 megalitres a day instead of the targeted 8 megalitres a day. Sedgefields daily water consumption target is 1.9 megalitres a day, but residents used 2.48 megalitres a day during the period under review. Knysna acting municipal manager Bevan Ellman reminded consumers that water restrictions have been in effect since November 2011. Far too often, we see illegal car washes pop up with no regard to water usage. Boat owners are also seen spraying their boats off with municipal water, said Ellman. We have instructed our law-enforcement officers to clamp down on water wastage. No mercy will be shown, and those wasting water will be fined heavily. Ellman urged residents to report water abuse to the municipality WhatsApp number, 083 665 3824
