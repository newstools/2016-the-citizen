North West premier Supra Mahumapelo received a hero s welcome as he arrived at a Reconciliation Day commemoration, where President Jacob Zuma was expected to speak later in the day, in Gopane near Zeerust on Friday. Women ululated and men whistled as he made his way into a giant white tent. Members of the ANC Women s League, wearing their signature green and black attire, waved miniature South African flags in welcome. This year s commemoration builds on the 60th anniversary of the Women s March to the Union Buildings in 1956. It also commemorates the bravery of women in Zeerust in 1957, when they revolted against passes in the villages of Dinokana, Lekgopung and Motswedi villages. Brave women in these communities risked the ire of the authorities when they refused to collect their passbooks from mobile units. President Zuma said ahead of the celebration: We salute the women of Gopane village in Zeerust who organised a march against pass laws, also in 1957. Their actions illustrate the active participation of women in the struggle for liberation, not only in urban areas but in rural areas as well. This serves as an inspiration as we continue building a new nation, founded on the values of human rights, justice and equality, he said. The commemoration was being held under the theme Bridging the divide towards a non-racial society . Hundreds of people watched cultural music groups performing on stage as they waited for President Jacob Zuma to arrive.
