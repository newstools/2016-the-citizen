The City of Tshwane will be spreading some cheer on Christmas Eve when they will host scores of homeless people in the city and treat them to a special dinner. Tshwane MMC for health and social development, Sakkie Du Plooy, said the dinner will be preceded by a church service to be held at the Bosman Street Church in Pretoria. Tshwane spokesperson Linda Mashigo said both the sermon and dinner is a communal led venture steered by the Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality, non-governmental organisations and the Tshwane Leadership Forum on the observance of Christmas celebrations.

About 800 people, of which 100 are women, sleep at the Struben Street Shelter. Sunnyside Apostolic Faith Mission, a member of the Churches Forum, will steer the Christmas carols and church service under the leadership of Pastor Harold Roberts. It is anticipated that some of the city councillors as well as the speaker of the city council will be in attendance, Mashigo said. Du Plooy said earlier there might be well over 8 000 homeless people on the streets of the City of Tshwane. A total of 624 of these people are children and about 1 500 are older than 60. Mashigo said they hope to bring some cheer to these disadvantaged people. The event takes place tonight at 7pm at the Bosman Street Church on the corner of Bosman and Madiba streets.
