National rowing coach Roger Barrow has been recognised for his efforts in lifting the status of the sport in South Africa, after being named World Rowing Coach of the Year. &#8220;Roger Barrow has spearheaded the development of elite rowing in South Africa,&#8221; global body World Rowing said in a statement on Friday, confirming he had received the accolade. Barrow, who guided the SA men&#8217;s lightweight four to gold at the London Olympics in 2012, produced superb results at the Rio Games in August. The national squad had hoped to return home from Rio with a handful of medals, but only the men&#8217;s pair of Shaun Keeling and Lawrence Brittain were able to step on the podium after bagging silver. The improved depth in the team was significant, however, and with Barrow&#8217;s assistance, five SA boats reached A finals in their events.
