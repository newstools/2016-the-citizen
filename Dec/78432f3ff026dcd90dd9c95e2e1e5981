Police have appealed to the public for help to arrest a man who shot a University of Johannesburg student at an off-campus residence on Rissik Street, central Johannesburg. The first-year student was shot dead on November 5, 2016, during an end-of-year party at the residence. Initial reports on the tragic incident suggested that the shooter was a security guard. Police on Tuesday requested the public to help trace the suspected shooter named as 23-year-old Philani Ndumiso Mabaso, who has been on the run since the fatal shooting of Elizo Baloyi, 21. The motive of the murder remains unknown. The suspect is thought to be hiding in KwaZulu-Natal. Police appealed to anyone with information on the whereabouts of the wanted suspect to contact Johannesburg Central detective Warrant Officer Rathiteng Selate on 082-776-8820 or 011 497-7269.
