Why, we have to ask, is it during these festive times that this country s glorious beaches become such flashpoints? At Blythedale Beach on the KwaZulu-Natal North Coast, a man was stabbed to death and the body reportedly left overnight after what was confirmed by authorities as a liquor-fuelled overnight party, which got out of hand. Clearly, murder on the beach is not a cheap detective novel, but a stark reality. This must be a subject of urgent concern for the relevent authorities. But, we would suggest, so are disturbing reports of an upmarket beach in Saldanha Bay in the Cape being reserved for residents and the issuance of passes by the local council to ensure entrance. Self-imposed economic elitism leaves a bitter taste. There was even louder outrage voiced over an obscenity-laden series of tweets emanating from a racist posting on Facebook on overcrowding of beaches. This, like a similar posting by estate agent Penny Sparrow, have longer-term effects on the already fragile race relations among our citizens. What is so disconcerting is simply that public beaches should, and indeed must, be accessible. A beach is no setting for a violent death or rampant racism.
