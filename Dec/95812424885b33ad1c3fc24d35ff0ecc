Set to take place at the MGM National Harbour in Washington DC, in the US, on December 18, this is where Miss World, Mireia Lalaguna of Spain, will crown her successor. South Africans can download the MobStar app and vote for Kunene as part of their favourite top three contestants at www.missworld.com/contestants/South-Africa2/.
