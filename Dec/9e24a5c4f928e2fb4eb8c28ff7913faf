Cricket, even when played at the lowest rung of the ladder, has earned a reputation for pay up and play the game fairness, which is not always justified. There surely can be no ulterior motives in AB de Villiers deciding to hand the Proteas captain s armband to Faf du Plessis. But this has been meat and drink for the controversy theorists, despite the former skipper and the incumbent captain being schoolboy friends and valuable members of the national side. The naysayers would tell you that De Villiers has grown tired of international cricket. But you just have to get one look of AB s slightly lopsided grin when he talks about the game to know that is a myth. De Villiers, the sceptics would have us believe, makes so much money from playing limited-over cricket on a worldwide level that the attractions of spending five days on the field are starting to bear down on him at the age of 32. You must surely discount this as just another manifestation of the tall poppy syndrome. What should be taken into account is that the previous incumbent, Hashim Amla, stepped down as captain and was allowed to do so with grace and dignity. Allow AB the same courtesy.
