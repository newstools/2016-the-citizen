Musician Greg Lake, who co-founded both King Crimson and Emerson, Lake and Palmer bands that helped define the sprawling, influential but often-maligned genre known as progressive rock has died of cancer at 69. He was instrumental in bringing in classical influences, epic length, mythic scope and 70s excess into rock n roll, winning millions of fans before punk swept in and spoiled the party. His manager, Stewart Young, said Lake died on Wednesday after a long and stubborn battle with cancer . Born in the English town of Poole in 1947, Lake founded King Crimson with guitarist Robert Fripp in the 60s. The band pioneered the genre known as progressive rock. He went on to form ELP with keyboardist Keith Emerson and drummer Carl Palmer. The band released six platinum-selling albums. Emerson died in March from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at his home in California. Palmer, the group s sole survivor, said: Greg s soaring voice and skill as a musician will be remembered by all who knew his music .
