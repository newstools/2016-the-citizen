In many other contexts, Allister Coetzee would sit in front of the South African Rugby Union&#8217;s (Saru) high performance committee on Tuesday with absolutely no ammunition for a positive performance review. His short reign has seen the Springboks sink to unprecedented lows as they finished with a pitiful four victories in 12 Tests in 2016. More depressingly, Coetzee hasn&#8217;t even put some stamp of authority on the way the Boks play. Also read: At least provincialism won&#8217;t get Allister Coetzee fired In fact, many observers and fans can&#8217;t exactly figure out what type of rugby the national side is trying to play. But Coetzee will more than likely survive an awkward meeting with his employer. Here&#8217;s why. Money When Saru approached Coetzee for the job, he was reportedly earning R6 million annually at his Japanese club Kobelco Steelers. However, he was willing to take a pay cut in order to realise a &#8220;long-held dream&#8221; of coaching the Boks. That said, Coetzee still earns around R4 million per year in South Africa and given that he&#8217;s signed a four-year contract, Saru will have to cough up close to R13 million if they choose to buy him out. For an organisation that&#8217;s projecting a loss of R150 million in 2017 if they can&#8217;t find a title sponsor for the Boks, that&#8217;s money Saru doesn&#8217;t have. Staff issues An employer like Saru has grounds for dismissal if a coach chose his own support staff and they failed to make an impact. But that&#8217;s not the case with Coetzee. He controversially had Mzwandile Stick (backs) and Johann van Graan (forwards) forced on him as assistants before he was eventually granted permission to appoint Matt Proudfoot as a third lieutenant. Now it&#8217;s probably unlikely results would&#8217;ve improved dramatically if Coetzee actually could&#8217;ve picked his own support staff but it&#8217;s still a leg to stand on. After all, he can argue he only worked with what was given to him. Transformation The irony is Coetzee&#8217;s record in this regard is actually quite poor. Saru&#8217;s strategic transformation plan for the Springboks decreed that black representation needed to be at 35% for every Test in 2016 (8 out of a match squad of 23). The Bok coach only reached that target in three of his 12 Tests. And you thought a non-white coach would pick more non-white players&#8230; Nonetheless, it&#8217;s understood several high-profile politicos believe Coetzee still deserves a chance. Given how Saru is still banned from hosting international events due to not meeting their transformation targets, this is an important consideration. Who else is there? Nobody wants this job. That&#8217;s the scary reality. Dave Rennie, the experienced New Zealander who&#8217;s won two Super Rugby titles with the Chiefs, had been approached but wants no interference whatsoever. That simply isn&#8217;t going to happen. Johan Ackermann, the Lions coach, has apparently declined an offer. Another consideration is that the experience level of local coaches is simply too low to pick an international coach out of. Most of them are only in their second campaign at senior level.
