Four foreign nationals are set to appear in the Benoni Magistrates Court on Wednesday for a formal bail application after they were arrested for drug dealing in a R3 million clandestine laboratory in Pomona, Ekurhuleni. Captain Ndivhuwo Mulamu said Taiwanese nationals Chi-Yu Fan and Chi-Chin Fan and a Mozambican duo of Orcidio Sitoe and Peters Ngwenya were remanded in custody when they made a brief appearance in the same court on Monday. Mulamu said three suspects were arrested last week when the Hawks, the South African Narcotics Enforcement Bureau and Vaal Rand K9 raided a plot on Thomas Road in Pomona. Police recovered a clandestine laboratory with an estimated value of R3 million where the suspects manufactured crystal meth. Police seized drugs, chemicals and drug manufacturing equipment. Mulamu said the four suspects were linked to the underground lab and were subsequently arrested. Another suspect, who is believed to be the kingpin of this underground operation, has been instructed to hand himself over to the police within 24 hours. He will be in the company of his legal representatives, Mulamu said. The suspects are facing charges of dealing in drugs and manufacturing drugs.
