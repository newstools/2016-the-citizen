The Democratic Alliance (DA) in KwaZulu-Natal on Tuesday, said it had reliably learnt that eThekwini City Manager, Sbu Sithole, was unlawfully sacked after he allegedly blocked African National Congress cadre deployment into several municipal positions. Last week, eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede suspended Sithole with a mere 18 days left on his contract. Gumede hand delivered a notice to Sithole calling for the early termination of his contract forthwith . In a statement, DA provincial leader Zwakele Mncwango said they believed that Sithole was the victim of ANC bullying, which was stopping at nothing to insert its cadres into government jobs. ANC regional secretary, Bheki Ntuli, recently released an internal ANC communication asking branches to submit names of loyal members to get government jobs in eThekwini. The deadline of 30 December requires his branches to send names who will then apparently get the jobs, Mncwango said. This is a gross and disgraceful undermining of employment practices, and it shows that the ANC will break the rules to dispense patronage. Mncwango said the DA believed that the Sithole was the last bulwark against this ANC programme, and therefore Gumede had to sack him. Now, a whole week later, Mayor Gumede has realized that her sacking of the City Manager was illegal and had called a special council meeting for this week to try and rectify her mistake, Mncwango said. It is alarming that the Mayor has attempted this scheme during Council recess. Mncwango said the DA would oppose this act by Gumede at the special council.
