The SA National Defence Force (SANDF) was on Wednesday evening preparing to receive the mortal remains of the South African soldier killed during a gun fight with rebels in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) on Monday, December 19. The SANDF said in a statement that it would inscribe his name on the wall of remembrance, acknowledging him as a hero who paid the ultimate price while contributing towards peace, stability and prosperity in the continent . This gallant soldier performed duties not only for the benefit of the people of the Republic of South Africa but for the entire African continent. Therefore, his death was definitely not in vain, the SANDF said. Affectionately known as Bushi by colleagues and friends, Rifleman Mokhothu had made it known that he wanted to be a successful paratrooper and then to fulfil a childhood dream of becoming a presidential close-protector (bodyguard). As a community member, he was involved in various projects with the youth of Botshabelo township, including mentoring and training young people in stage drama and street soccer. The statement added that Rifleman Mokhothu had single-handedly established a youth traditional dance group, the Bokamoso Traditional Dance Group, which contributed to youth skill empowerment in Botshabelo. The SANDF will receive and hand over his mortal remains to his family on Friday, December 30 during a ceremonial parade at Air Force Base Waterkloof. The acting chief of the SANDF, Lieutenant General Zimpande Msimang, accompanied by the Chief of the South African Army Lieutenant General Lindile Yam, will officiate at the ceremonial parade.
