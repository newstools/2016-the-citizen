About R60 million worth of protected brands on counterfeit goods were seized in the Johannesburg CBD on Tuesday, the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) said. Spokesperson Captain Ndivhuwo Mulamu said this was a phase one of a search-and-seizure operation by the Hawks, the South African Police Service (SAPS), department of home affairs, customs and South African Revenue Service (Sars). Mulamu said the authorities searched 120 shops at Quebec Building in the CBD, where they confiscated clothes, bags, cosmetics, accessories, and jewellery of the protected brand names including Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Dolce and Gabbana, Adidas, Nike, Puma, Soviet, Converse and Guess worth an estimated R60 million. A man was arrested for trying to bribe the authorities while they were searching the shops, and seven were arrested for not having legal documents required to be in the republic. The operation was targeted to achieve successes on trading in counterfeit goods, tax evasion, money laundering and human trafficking, Mulamu said. &#8211; African News Agency For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
