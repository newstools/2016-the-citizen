If Allister Coetzee, the embattled Springbok coach, is somehow fired by the South African Rugby Union (Saru) next week, it won&#8217;t be down to provincial pettiness. The local governing body on Friday announced national coaches will in future only be appointed and dismissed by its executive council. This new provision is just one of numerous constitutional changes made at a meeting of Saru&#8217;s general council in Cape Town. Also read: Why Saru s general meeting on Friday is crucial Previously, all 14 provincial presidents had the power to vote on whether to keep the Springbok coach or not. Saru have also made sure its executive council, of which some union presidents are also members, becomes more independent. This council will now have five independent members. The other changes bring us more in line with modern business practice by increasing independent representation, said Mark Alexander, Saru&#8217;s president. The new way of doing things will probably be a culture shock to some administrators but Jurie Roux, Saru&#8217;s chief executive, praised them for &#8220;putting South African rugby first&#8221;. &#8220;Some people on the general council made some tough decisions, decisions their constituency would not necessarily agree with,&#8221; he admitted. Coetzee&#8217;s awkward performance review &#8211; he only won four of his 12 Tests in 2016 &#8211; will be conducted on Tuesday by Saru&#8217;s high-performance committee. As expected, private investors are now allowed to have a 74% stake in a provincial union and would at least go some way to helping them with their cash crunch. Also read: Oops! Saru to cough up for their doctors&#8217; Hougaard-mistake &#8220;We make no secret of the fact that in these tough economic times the rugby business is taking the same strain that every other South African business is facing,&#8221; said Alexander. &#8220;There is a battle to find and retain sponsors and supporters and we could not continue to do business in the same way.&#8221; In line with the South African Sport Confederation and Olympic Committee&#8217;s (Sascoc) new requirements, Saru&#8217;s members are now aligned with the country&#8217;s geopolitical boundaries. That means there are now only 9 members on Saru&#8217;s general council but still 14 unions. The decision on the new format of the Currie Cup, which apparently will now feature the top seven sides in the premier division, has been put on hold. Discussions on that will only resume next month.
