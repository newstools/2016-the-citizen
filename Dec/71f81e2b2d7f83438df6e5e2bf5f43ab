Click here for a live scorecard. 16.57: Stumps have been called. That&#8217;s it for the day. 16.32: For all the gimmicks to try and keep Test cricket alive, it doesn&#8217;t help when umpires take players off for bad light like this. It&#8217;s apparently not all that dark. But the umpires offer the light and the visitors take it. SL 181/7. 16.30: Dhananjaya de Silva has a Test average of 61 going into this game. He&#8217;s showing that batting ability by moving to 42. The Proteas&#8217; lead is slowly but surely shrinking. It&#8217;s now 105. SL 181/7. 16.00: OUT! Rangana Herath is known for chancing his arm but was that reverse sweep really on? Keshav Maharaj keeps his line consistent and lets the impetuosity of the veteran spinner do the rest. SL 157/7. 15.50: Good partnership building between Dhananjaya de Silva and Rangana Herath. They take the Sri Lankans past 150 as they exploit the off-colour bowling of Kagiso Rabada. SL 153/6. 15.18: Dinesh Chandimal was looking good after tea but he succumbs to a Philander delivery that jags back and traps him in front. The review is wasted. SL 121/6. 14.40: Philander bowls a lovely over before tea yet without much success. SL 104/5. 14.27: Dhananjaya de Silva cuts a short one from Maharaj to the boundary to bring up Sri Lanka&#8217;s 100. 14.23: Kagiso Rabada has found his range. Chandimal is leading a charmed life as he gets a thick edge on another excellent ball. Quinton de Kock gets his right hand to it but it won&#8217;t stick. Valiant effort. SL 99/5. 14.20: Even Keshav Maharaj looks like a new bowler after the Mathews wicket. He beats Chandimal&#8217;s edge with a beautiful, flighted delivery and almost has him stumped. 14.12: OUT! Kagiso Rabada hasn&#8217;t been at his best but he has a knack of taking vital wickets. He does it again with the probing delivery outside off. Angelo Mathews goes for it and it finds the edge for Dean Elgar at slip. SL 94/5. 14.09: Sri Lanka&#8217;s batting lynchpins, Angelo Mathews and Dinesh Chandimal, have steadied the ship. That said they were also helped by Keshav Maharaj&#8217;s charitable first over. SL 94/4. 13.41: It&#8217;s drinks. Kyle Abbott almost yorks Dinesh Chandimal and might&#8217;ve had a case if he still had a review left for LBW. But we all know that ship sailed&#8230;.. SL 72/4. 13.25: WICKET! It&#8217;s time for Sri Lanka to call a bad review. Vernon Philander keeps it simple &#8211; straight on an awkward length and Kausal Silva is trapped in front. Asking for the review was a bit desperate. SL 61/4. 13.02: Another indifferent review by the Proteas. Vernon Philander traps Mathews in front but he&#8217;s planted himself close to off-stump and the ball hits him outside the line. SL 52/3. 12.59: Sri Lanka reach their 50 with Angelo Mathews&#8217; crisp drive for four. 12.02: The Protea bowlers have responded well after the batting collapsed. Conditions have certainly favoured them. SL 37/3 and suddenly 286 looks a good total. 11.48: What on earth was Quinton de Kock thinking? He convinces Faf du Plessis to review a leave from Angelo Mathews. Replays show the bat was miles away. What a waste! 11.36: WICKET! It&#8217;s going downhill fast for the Sri Lankans! Kusal Mendis, the Islanders new batting hero after his heroics against Australia, plays a loose cut and De Kock takes an excellent catch. A second for Kyle Abbott. SL 22/3. 11.26: OUT! Despite bowling neatly, Vernon Philander&#8217;s first stick is a bit of a late Christmas gift. Kusal Perera slashes at a fairly wide delivery but the extra bounce should&#8217;ve made him leave that one. Poor shot. SL 19/2. 11.11: GONE! Kyle Abbott has settled in very quickly. He immediately discomforted Dimuth Karunaratne and snags him in his second over with a juicy fuller one that wasn&#8217;t there to drive. Good start for the Proteas. SL 10/1. 11.04: This is not going to be an easy first few overs for the Sri Lankans. Kyle Abbott has immediately found his range and already troubling Dimuth Karunaratne. SL 8/0. 10.46: ALL OVER! Quinton de Kock needed to look for boundaries and keep Kagiso Rabada off strike but he clearly didn&#8217;t bank on a superb in-swinging yorker from Nuwan Pradeep. South Africa have lost their last four wickets for 19 runs. Sri Lanka on top as they dismiss the hosts for 286. 10.33: SHOCKER! Quinton de Kock plays an attacking cut shot after striking a boundary the previously delivery. He is keen on a second run, convinces Kyle Abbott to come and then sends him back. What a dummy he sold him there! SA 281/9. 10.28: GONE! Suranga Lakmal made his Test debut in 2010. It took him six years to achieve his first five-wicket haul &#8230; and it&#8217;s a sweet one. He keeps it tight on an off-stump length and it moves away subtly for Keshav Maharaj to have a nibble. SA 276/8. 10.21: WICKET! Nuwan Pradeep is rewarded with Vernon Philander&#8217;s scalp. A well-directed short ball is hooked but Philander doesn&#8217;t get all of it and he&#8217;s caught at deep square. The plan worked! SA 276/7. 10.13: Pradeep&#8217;s second over is far better. Vernon Philander actually gets lucky with the fifth ball as he gloves an attempted pull but keeper Dinesh Chandimal can&#8217;t hold on. 10.04: The first over is completed and it&#8217;s a meek one. Kepler Wessels, on SuperSport, lambasts Nuwan Pradeep for a &#8220;nothing over&#8221;. &#8220;He didn&#8217;t even look warmed-up,&#8221; he says. 09.58: What exactly went wrong with the Proteas on Monday? JP Duminy believes it was a combination of factors. 09.55: Welcome to day two at St George&#8217;s Park. The Islanders surprised all and sundry with their fighting spirit on Monday. The Proteas will rely on Quinton de Kock to spearhead the lower order. It all makes for an interesting script. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
