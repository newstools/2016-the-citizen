The Peace and Security Council of the African Union (AU PSC) at its 642nd meeting has commended Gambia on the successful presidential elections held on December 1. The AU PSC was briefed in Addis Ababa on Tuesday by the Commissioner for Peace and Security on the elections. Council congratulated ousted President Yahya Jammeh for the peaceful conduct, transparency, and the excellent conditions under which the elections were held. Jammeh s acceptance of the election results by recognising the victory of president-elect Adama Barrow was highlighted. The African organisation further commended Gambians for their political mobilisation, maturity and commitment to democratic change. Hope was also expressed that Gambia, as a result of this election, would go through a peaceful and orderly transition process. The AU PSC finally reaffirmed its strong commitment to the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance, the implementation of which guarantees respect for constitutional order on the continent.
