If you can&#8217;t beat them, join them; this saying also applies to car makers even today, as BMW is slowly showing an interest in creating a convertible based on its X2 set to rival the Range Rover Evoque Convertible. According to an Australian publication, future model planning staff at BMW are closely watching demand for the Evoque Convertible to see if it is worth producing an X2 Convertible, and if it goes as expected, it would be the first droptop X model. . Sales of the Evoque Convertible started in September and more than 1 200 examples were sold worldwide. Clearly then, the market for a premium, convertible SUV isn t huge, but it doesn t necessarily need to be for BMW executives to be tempted. . Underpinning the fixed-roof X2 will be the same platform as the X1 and beyond strengthening the chassis and chopping off the roof, the X2 Convertible would essentially be identical to its sibling.
