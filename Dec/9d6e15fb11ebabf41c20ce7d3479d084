Afrikaans musician Steve Hofmeyr and his wife, Janine, are expecting a baby girl. The couple used their Facebook accounts to share the good news with fans, with Steve already sending out an invitation to his daughter&#8217;s birthday as a one-year-old in 2018. The couple, who had been trying to get pregnant for a long time, have already picked a name for their baby girl: Romy-Lee, named after Janine&#8217;s mother. &#8220;The birth of a Child changed the world forever. That s why we choose Christmas Day to invite you to Romy-Lee s 1st birthday on 1 July 2018 . We are still a risky case. Perhaps still a miracle. You prayed her for us. Our gratitude and excitement is boundless today. We tried for a long time. The biggest Christmas gift ever. Thank you,&#8221; Steve wrote in Afrikaans. Janine also shared the exciting news on Facebook, saying the day she heard the news was the best of her life. However, for a couple who had been trying for a long time, she said she wished she could give a &#8220;firm&#8221; hug to every woman who was still trying to get pregnant. &#8220;I know the hell you are going through.&#8221; Picture: Facebook She wrote, also in Afrikaans: &#8220;Everyone, I am going to become a mommy to a beautiful little princess!!!!! Except for my wedding day, it was the best day of my life when I heard. I am soooo happy the news has finally been broken, and soooo grateful for every beautiful wish. Her name is Romy-Lee (named after my mother) and I can t wait to start shopping. &#8220;Wow, I am so excited today, there is still a very painful part deep in my heart. I wish I could give a firm hug today to every woman who still hopes and tries, and even to those who can never have children. Because I know the hell you are going through. &#8220;Also wish everyone a very blessed Christmas with your loved ones. &#8220;All our love, &#8220;Steve, Janine, Seb, Ben and Romy-Lee.&#8221; Congratulations to the Hofmeyr family, we cannot wait to meet Romy-Lee.
