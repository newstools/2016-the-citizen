In a serious case of dodgy spin-doctoring, African soccer legend Yaya Toure on Tuesday apologised to Manchester City fans after being charged for drinking and driving last month but insisted it was &#8220;unintentional&#8221;. The big midfielder confirmed on his Facebook page that he chose not to contest the charge because he was &#8220;above the permitted level&#8221; when he was pulled off on the night in question. But many people are still scratching their heads as they wonder how Toure, a Muslim who doesn&#8217;t drink, was caught. &#8220;Over the last two weeks there has been some confusion,&#8221; Toure wrote. &#8220; I have always refused alcohol. Anyone who knows me or follows football will have seen me refuse champagne for man-of-the-match performances because of my commitment to my religion.&#8221; He then sought to clarify the whole misunderstanding. &#8220;It was important to me that I told the court that I had not intentionally consumed alcohol,&#8221; Toure continued. &#8220;The judge in his sentencing remarks accepted that I had not been intentionally drinking. Drink-driving is a serious crime and even though I was not intentionally consuming alcohol I accept the ban and fine and I would like to apologise for this situation.&#8221; However, the question of whether somebody forced a bottle of whiskey down his throat will remain unanswered.
