President Jacob Zuma on Tuesday, on behalf of the Government and the people of South Africa, extended the South Africa s deepest condolences to the Government and people of the Russian Federation and in particular, to the family of the Russian Ambassador to Turkey Andrey Karlov. The ambassador was assassinated on Monday evening in Ankara. The South African Government joins the international community in condemning this brutal attack against a diplomat, which is in violation of the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, said Zuma in a statement issued by the department of international relations and cooperation. We would like to convey our deepest condolences to H.E President Vladimir Putin, the Government of the Russian Federation, and in particular to the family of the Ambassador Karlov. We also wish those injured in the attack, a speedy and full recovery. Terrorism in any form and from whichever quarter constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security, and any acts of terrorism are criminal, unjustifiable and cannot be condoned. To this end, South Africa wishes to reiterate its commitment to international initiatives aimed at fighting the scourge of terrorism and violent extremism, said the president.
