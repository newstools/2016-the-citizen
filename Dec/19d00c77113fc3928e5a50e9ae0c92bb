In an economy as direly stretched as that of our basket case northern neighbours, which has already all but descended into a barter system, even the vaguest suggestion that Zimbabwe is trading wild animals to defray debts must be viewed with the utmost trepidation. Reports suggesting geriatric President Robert Mugabe s wife Grace has been using part of Africa s precious and fast diminishing wildlife resources to pay off indebtedness are worrying to say the least. These reports, hastily denied by the Zimbabwean embassy in China, indicate that Zimbabwe exported a variety of wild animals to settle a Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) debt, and list at least 35 elephant calves, eight lions, a dozen hyenas and a giraffe being exported to China to settle the outstanding costs of boots and uniforms bought for the Congolese military force. The elephant calves estimates of their value range between $40 000 and $60 000 the report adds, were flown out of the country in a Boeing 747 to the Chimelong Safari Park in Guangzhou. Zimbabwe has a less-than-stellar conservation history and if even a glimmer of the truth of this is ever revealed as having some substance, all of Africa should be concerned.
