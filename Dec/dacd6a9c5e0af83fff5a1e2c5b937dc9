The City of Cape Town said on Thursday there has been a steady decline in the daily consumption of water, but urged residents to reduce this even further as the hot summer months approach. Ernest Sonnenberg, mayoral committee member for utility services, said: There has been a steady decline in the volume of water used since last week, with total consumption standing at an average of 854 million litres per day, as opposed to 870-890 million litres from November 14 to 21 . Sonnenberg said there was still a need to ensure that consumption did not exceed 800 million litres per day as the city was still using too much water and could not guarantee that dams would not be depleted to dangerous levels by the end of summer. In the past week, dam levels have declined by 1.3%, from 55.8% to 54.5%. According to the city s calculations, if residents are able to ensure that their water consumption over the coming summer months does not exceed their consumption over winter, we will be able to meet this target [of 800 million litres per day], said Sonnenberg. The city extends its thanks to those residents and industrial users who have contributed to this recent improvement. However, there are many who, as yet, have not addressed their wastefulness. We would like to encourage these users to visit http://www.capetown.gov.za/thinkwater for water-saving hints and tips. Sonnenberg further urged residents and industrial users to continue raising awareness around the issue and to report water wastage where they saw it. Residents should do their part in disseminating this message and report contraventions to water.restrictions@capetown.gov.za, said Sonnenberg.
