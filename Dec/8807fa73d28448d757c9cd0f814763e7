Theo Walcott gave Arsenal a fifth-minute lead, but Leroy Sane equalised early in the second half, getting the benefit of the doubt in a tight offside call to run in and score from David Silva&#8217;s pass. Raheem Sterling struck a 71st-minute winner, but Wenger felt Silva&#8217;s attempt to play the ball in front of goalkeeper Petr Cech should have seen the goal ruled out. &#8220;We conceded two offside goals, which is very difficult to accept in a game of that stature,&#8221; Wenger told his post-match press conference. &#8220;As it is well known, the referees are protected very well, that is right, like the lions in the zoo. &#8220;So we have to live with those decisions. I want them to be safe. If they could make the right decision, it would be even better.&#8221; Arsenal&#8217;s defeat was the second game in succession they had gone ahead, only to lose 2-1, having fallen to defeat in similar circumstances at Everton on Tuesday. On that occasion, Wenger protested that Ashley Williams&#8217;s headed 86th-minute winner had stemmed from an erroneously awarded corner. The result saw City leapfrog Arsenal into second place, leaving them seven points adrift of leaders Chelsea. Chelsea won 3-1 at the Etihad Stadium two weeks ago, but City manager Pep Guardiola felt there was not much difference between that display and his side&#8217;s performance against Arsenal. &#8220;Arsenal were lucky in the first half,&#8221; Guardiola told the BBC. &#8220;It was a Premier League game and a good game for everybody. It was similar to the game against Chelsea. Then we played well and lost and today we won. &#8220;The guys give everything in every game. I&#8217;m happy to be City coach. In terms of spirit, it&#8217;s always there.&#8221; Adding to Arsenal&#8217;s problems, midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was forced off by injury in the second half just 13 minutes after coming on as a replacement for Alex Iwobi. &#8220;It looks a hamstring,&#8221; Wenger said. &#8220;It is a muscular problem.&#8221;
