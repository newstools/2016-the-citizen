As part of a 5FM Smart car challenge, DJ Fresh, real name Thato Sikwane, stuffed himself into a tiny For2 Smart car with seven other people and most of them, including him (he&#8217;s a bodybuilder, remember), were not small people either. It was quite the achievement! Their strategy was just to keep trying to &#8220;stuff as much as you can&#8221; into this two-seater car, which is obviously a lot more spacious than we might have thought. Though we wouldn&#8217;t recommend trying to drive to Cape Town like this. Watch the video below.
