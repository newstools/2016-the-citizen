Parliament s ad hoc joint committee tasked with the appointment of National Youth Development Agency (NYDA) board members has shortlisted 14 candidates to be interviewed next year, it said on Wednesday. The shortlisted candidates will be subjected to an intensive vetting process to ensure that they comply with the Act. In this regard, interviewing of any candidate will be subject to candidates passing the extensive vetting process, the parliamentary committee said. Interviews for the shortlisted and vetted candidates will be conducted on January 25 2017. In an effort to promote a culture of openness, the CVs of shortlisted candidates will be published on the parliamentary website. The candidates are Joy Maimela, Zandile Myeni, Zandile Majozi, Siyaduma Biniza, ANCYL deputy president Desmond Moela, Thembinkosi Josopu, Ndomiso Mokako, incumbent NYDA board chairman Yershen Pillay, Sifiso Mtsweni, Kenneth Morolong, Bavelile Hlongwa, Andile Biyela, Zilondiwe Goge and Siyabonga Magadla. The selection process was halted earlier this year to allow the committee to verify the ages and academic qualifications of the candidates after allegations of falsified qualifications and age cheating emerged.
