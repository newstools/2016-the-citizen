Two men who claimed to be employees of the SA Revenue Service (Sars) were arrested in Polokwane for allegedly defrauding job seekers in Polokwane, Limpopo police said on Friday. The suspects, a Zimbabwean and South African, were pretending to be Sars employees, soliciting CVs from jobseekers and thereafter telling them that they have been successful. They would then demand money from the victims, telling them it was for work uniforms and employee ID cards. On face value, the cards which have photos and IDs of potential employees, appear authentic as they bear Sars emblem or logo. The uniform a T-shirt, also had similar emblem, said Mojapelo. Several people were defrauded of cash of between R2500 and R3000 each, he said. Fake Sars ID cards and uniforms were confiscated from the two men s makeshift office in the Polokwane CBD. The two, aged 24 and 28, are expected to appear in the Polokwane Magistrate s Court on fraud charges. African News Agency (ANA) For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
