He&#8217;s the best ODI player in the world this year and has everyone excited about his form in the pinnacle format of the game too. But Quinton de Kock didn&#8217;t have the greatest of days on Tuesday during the second day of the first Test against Sri Lanka. Let&#8217;s just say he sold quite a few dummies. Watching, Allister Coetzee? It was supposed to rain at St George&#8217;s Park but the Weather Service got it wrong. Weather man got it all wrong this morning. It&#39;s a stunning day! If you not here you need to be! St George&#39;s Park! #nowwerecooking pic.twitter.com/MLegCU2zDc &mdash; Sunfoil Cricket (@SunfoilCricket) December 27, 2016 Nuwan Pradeep was lambasted in his first over of the day for being &#8220;lethargic&#8221; until Vernon Philander indulged him. Pradeep&#39;s 1st few balls were bit ropey, but he troubled Philander thereafter. Dropped after gloving a hook, now he splices one to midwicket &mdash; Ken Borland (@KenBorland) December 27, 2016 Suranga Lakmal made his debut in 2010. A whole SIX years later, he finally took his first five-wicket haul in Tests. If only his haircut could catch up too&#8230; A maiden five wicket haul for Lakmal who has Maharaj caught off Chandimal for a duck. #SAvSL &mdash; The Cricket Prof. (@CricProf) December 27, 2016 Most bowling innings for maiden five-for in Test career Jayasuriya &#8211; 83 M Waugh &#8211; 58 Border &#8211; 57 Sehwag &#8211; 57 Lakmal &#8211; 56#SAvSL &mdash; Shiva J (@Shiva_cricinfo) December 27, 2016 Having sold Kyle Abbott down the river with a calamitous run out, Quinny clearly forgot shepherding the tail means NOT getting out yourself. I was moaning about Sri Lanka no longer trying 2 get De Kock out&#8230;clearly he thought so 2, surprised &amp; bowled by a pinpoint Pradeep yorker &mdash; Ken Borland (@KenBorland) December 27, 2016 Sri Lanka&#8217;s fightback was admirable, especially given the freebies they gave the Proteas at the start. Quality stuff from Sri Lanka. SA were gifted 60-80 runs yesterday .. GAME ON #SAvsSL &mdash; Six Sotyelelwa (@The_Sports_Jock) December 27, 2016 Kyle Abbott and Vernon Philander&#8217;s opening burst promised another Sri Lankan batting collapse in South Africa. Backing one of Abbott or Philander to rip through the Lankans batting order. We should be batting again at stumps. &mdash; Hashbrown (@AssVegas) December 27, 2016 And Kaushal Silva&#8217;s wild slash didn&#8217;t really help matters&#8230; https://twitter.com/DaleSteyn62/status/813677468569702400 De Kock&#8217;s grab meant some fans even dressed up to support him. Seriously, Quinton&#8217;s Cocks? Retweet and like our picture to make us winners of the #CastleCorner challenge! pic.twitter.com/EszhbF16ma &mdash; Castle Lager SA (@CastleLagerSA) December 27, 2016 Shortly afterwards, Quinny produced another, erm, cock-up with a terrible review of Angelo Mathews&#8217; non-existent edge. A superb dummy of Faf du Plessis. Piss poor review &mdash; Six Sotyelelwa (@The_Sports_Jock) December 27, 2016 And the &#8220;cock-ups&#8221; kept on coming as he dropped a difficult chance offered by Dinesh Chandimal. There was a reason why the Proteas were wary of that second life. This is Chandimal&#39;s first Test since August vs Australia. He scored 132 and 43 in that match. #SAvSL &mdash; The Cricket Prof. (@CricProf) December 27, 2016 Yet Quinny couldn&#8217;t dampen the PE brass band&#8217;s spirit. PE Brass Band playing &quot;Asambe Lolo&quot; for the masses here at St Georges Park&#8230; for a moment I thought I was at Lucas Moripe Stadium. &mdash; Sibusiso Mjikeliso (@Sbu_Fundraiser) December 27, 2016 Maybe it&#8217;s the tumbling wickets, but the fast bowlers weren&#8217;t really too keen to complete their overs quickly. (Is Faf in trouble again after this?) Twelve and a half overs per hour in that session. Again &#8230; hardly helps the preservation of Test cricket. &mdash; Rob Houwing (@RobHouwing) December 27, 2016 Keshav Maharaj says Rangana Herath is his mentor. Therefore, this was rather ironic&#8230; Keshav Maharaj&#39;s first Test wicket at home is Rangana Herath, his hero. #SAvSL #cricket &mdash; Firdose Moonda (@FirdoseM) December 27, 2016 Rangana Herath is always trying things, fun to watch, but that reverse-sweep was too much, full &amp; quicker from Maharaj &amp; he&#39;s lbw for 24 &mdash; Ken Borland (@KenBorland) December 27, 2016 Some commentators say the Dolphins tweaker doesn&#8217;t turn the ball. What on earth are they talking about? Maharaj has got 4.98 degrees of turn on average, the most by any spinner in this match #SAvSL &mdash; The Cricket Prof. (@CricProf) December 27, 2016 Bad light stopped play. And, yes, it&#8217;s all the umpires&#8217; fault! Umpires don&#39;t &quot;offer&quot; light anymore. No longer players decisions&#8230; https://t.co/4x1oDk5EyH &mdash; Neil Manthorp (@NeilManthorp) December 27, 2016 For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
