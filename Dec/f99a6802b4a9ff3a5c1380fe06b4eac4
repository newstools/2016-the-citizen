Three men, facing child pornography charges, are expected to apply for bail in the Durban Magistrate s Court on Thursday. On December 1, National Prosecuting Authority spokeswoman Natasha Ramkisson-Kara said that one of the men was charged with raping a minor, sexual assault, sexual exploitation of a child, sexual grooming of a child, using a child for or benefiting from child pornography, creation, possession and distribution of child porn. The other two men face charges of creation, possession and distribution of child pornography. The three were arrested following a joint operation involving the police and the United States Department of Homeland Security. They were arrested in the Bluff, Pinetown and Waterfall areas of Durban. At the time, police spokesman Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said that one of the victims was a six-year-old, whose images were found on the cell phone of one of the accused men.
