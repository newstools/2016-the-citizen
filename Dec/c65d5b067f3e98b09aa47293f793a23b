Following the passing of gospel artist Sfiso Ncwane on Monday, his two children and wife, Ayanda Ncwane, took to social media to share a heartbreaking tribute to their father. &#8220;To my father: Thank you for everything you have done for the whole family. I know you didn&#8217;t mean to leave us. I hope that you (rest in peace) and I promise I will follow in your footsteps. There will never be another loving father like you. Love you guys with all my life,&#8221; wrote his first born son Ngcweti Ncwane. Ngcweti has always shared with the world his admiration for his father and how supportive he has been to him. He previously wrote a sweet message to him, saying he had forgiven him for not being at home at the time, as the world also needed him.
