Choreographer Somizi Mhlongo has taken it upon himself to educate people about the different kinds of gay people in the world. In a video posted on Instagram, he was at a restaurant and two gay men were sitting behind him. One of them was &#8220;different&#8221;, so he decided to explain to people all the kinds that are out there. According to him, there are those who are &#8220;too much&#8221; and show it in the way they walk. Then there are those who are educated and have money. There are also those who are &#8220;rachet&#8221; (nasty), and the ones who are forward, according to the choreographer. Check out the video below: Ungu star bani?
