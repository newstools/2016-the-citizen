The litigious nature of the DA, which highlights the opposition party s propensity to run to the courts for a solution, has provided some signs of success and added some failures to the cause of governance. At best, it forces a reluctant government to take action; at worst, it bogs down urgent issues in the quicksand of claim and counterclaim, suit and countersuit. But we stand fully behind the DA s call that the R17.3 million awarded to 11 executives at the massively underperforming quango, PetroSA, be repaid immediately and in full. Likewise, we stand behind the opposition s contention that the opinion which informed this disastrous payment , obtained from the head of PetroSA s head of legal services, Mokgaetsi Sebothoma, who was paid R2.4 million despite leading the failed Project Irene, be made public and tabled before parliament. It is courting disaster for state-aligned enterprises especially those as strategic as PetroSA to be given an open cheque book. It s certainly not for the board to award themselves dubious bonuses after a string of disastrous decisions that have resulted in a mind-numbing R14.5 billion shortfall.
