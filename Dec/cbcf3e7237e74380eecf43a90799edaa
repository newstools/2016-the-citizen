So maybe Allister Coetzee wasn&#8217;t quite spinning a tall tale when he gave his reasons for not picking Duane Vermeulen for the Springboks&#8217; nightmarish tour of Europe. The embattled national rugby coach at the time said the experienced eighthman was not match fit and had politely requested to rather stay behind to support his wife, Ezel, who was expecting the couple&#8217;s second child. Many fans were sceptical, believing Coetzee was using a convenient excuse to omit Vermeulen as payback for critical comments he had made about the Springbok mentor&#8217;s management of the side. But the second Vermeulen boy finally did make his arrival last week, though his proud dad only confirmed the news on Instagram three days later. Wondering why I was so quiet the past couple of days&#8230;&#8230;. coz this happened, 3 became 4 on Thursday morning 07:55am. We are truly blessed parents to have another boy in our lives. #3became4 #blessedbeyondmeasure #loosetriocomplete&#x1f3c9; #kisses A photo posted by Duane Vermeulen (@customs08) on Dec 4, 2016 at 4:37am PST Vermeulen, who currently plays for the French side Toulon, previously expressed his &#8220;frustration&#8221; at South African rugby&#8217;s poor decision-making. &nbsp;
