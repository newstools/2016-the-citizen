 There is a worrying trend of children who go missing under dubious circumstances and later found killed somewhere else. It s a trend that requires society in general and parents or guardians in particular to rise up to the challenge and take our responsibilities of safeguarding our future leaders, the SAPS said in a statement on Sunday. On Friday, two children were reported missing in Makhado and Waterval respectively. In Makhado, the police had opened a child stealing case. The incident happened when a 10-year-old girl child was allegedly lured by a total stranger to accompany him to buy her some sweets. According to information, the suspect entered the child s home in the town of Louis Trichardt under the pretense that he needed an accommodation. He was even given food. The suspect then left. That was the last time the child was seen. The suspect, who spoke Shona, is said to be 1.4 metres tall, has [a] small beard, and not neatly shaven. He was wearing a fawn pair of trousers and a black shirt with grey stripes, the statement said. The child s name was Merit Nyakumba and was last seen wearing a green and pink dress. Anyone with information was requested to contact Makhado SAPS at 015-5194-300 or Constable Irene Radzilane at 082-565-8233. A seven-year-old child from Waterval near Makhado also went missing this week. Earlier this month, on December 13, an eight-year-old child went missing in Nebo while playing with friends, and her partly decomposed body was found in the nearby mountains. We want to send a warning to all parents to take note that child neglect is a criminal offense which may result in the incarceration of the guilty persons. As parents we must at all times be vigilant and always have sight of where our children are playing. We are also making an appeal to everyone, including neighbours, to report incidents of child neglect to prevent this ugly trend, the SAPS said in the statement. African News Agency (ANA)
