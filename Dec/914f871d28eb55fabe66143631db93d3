The South Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg on Wednesday ordered the reinstatement of boom gates to Sandton suburb Hurlingham Manor. The Johannesburg Roads Agency (JRA) last week dismantled the gates because they did not comply with the security restriction policy. The boom gates were removed following a verbal notice by JRA. We recognised that we had not given the required notice and thus agreed to reinstate the gates, executive director for transport in the City of Johannesburg, Lisa Seftel, said.

The HMNRA has agreed to comply and grant access to the area, the mayoral committee on transport announced on Wednesday. But a separate hearing will now be established, in which HMNRA will state their case for automation and locking of pedestrian gates at the sitting arranged as part of the renewal process. This is a far better way of addressing issues than residents associations doing as they please on a public road. Residents associations are required to renew their approvals for security access restrictions every two years. The majority of the 400 residents associations are in compliance with the policy. If they want to make changes to the conditions, they engage the city, the committee said. The city will monitor and enforce the security access restriction policy to ensure the rights of residents freedom of movement is balanced, with measures to improve their safety.
