A difficult card awaits punters at the Greyville Polytrack on Friday but it may pay to be with Caroline s Call and Princess Varunya. Trainer Lezeanne Forbes has her yard in very good form and adding blinkers to Caroline s Call last time out seemed to work and brought about a much better effort. She should go close to winning Race 8, a FM 65 Handicap over 1200m. She has won on this surface before and while it is a weak-looking field and there are some clear dangers in the form of Go With Flo and Roy s Dancer. Go With Flo was only eighth on her debut but put in a much better effort second time out and won well over this course and distance. Roy s Dancer won well in her penultimate start and one can draw a bit of a line through her last run as she was badly drawn so was no means disgraced when fifth behind Icy Spirit. The Australian-bred Princess Varunya has won four starts in just 14 appearances and showed she is coming back to her best with a good third place finish behind Celtic Captain last time out. Trainer Kom Naidoo has opted for 4kg claimer Serena Moodley to reduce the 64kg down to 60kg and she should run well in Race 6, a FM 90 Handicap over 2000m. Her biggest threat is likely to come from Playboy Buddy. This filly has taken a shine to the Polytrack and will be right at home over this course and distance.
