Veteran radio host John Robbie retired this week and the 702 Radio Facebook page posted this video on Thursday of him giving staff a farewell speech. He advised them to &#8220;complain upwards&#8221; not moan to staff members below them, but emphasised that the talk station was excellent, a &#8220;very special place&#8221; and that the line-up of hosts was &#8220;world class&#8221;. He embraced his sound engineer of 27 years, Darius Mothibe, and wished his replacement, Xolani Gwala, the best of luck, despite the fact that Gwala is apparently &#8220;s**t scared&#8221; about taking over the breakfast show. Despite getting a bit emotional, he said &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to cry.&#8221; Watch his full speech plus his last few minutes on radio below:
