Model and presenter Bonang Matheba&#8217;s brother turns 18 and has requested a birthday present that is most of us working people&#8217;s dream. She shared on Twitter on Thursday how she was sad about her &#8220;lil&#8217; cupcake&#8221; growing up too fast. Of course when Bonang Matheba is your sister, your birthday present requests can&#8217;t be the same as the rest of us, so he asked her for a C63 AMG, and she&#8217;s actually considering it. https://twitter.com/bonang_m/status/809334506519982080 She said, however, that she would only buy it for him after seeing his matric results. https://twitter.com/bonang_m/status/809335418252627968 Not that buying him the car would affect Bonang&#8217;s bank balance in any way. Bonang, perhaps the highest-paid host in South Africa, bought her first house in her early 20s. It only got better from there, as she went on to buy a bigger house, being featured on the show she presents, Top Billing. She is a Revlon ambassador and was in the past few weeks named Brazilian footwear Ipanema s Africa ambassador. She also hosts The Front Row, which features Ask A Man, perhaps the only daily segment that trends on a daily basis. She is also vodka brand Ciroc s ambassador. Bonang has also been a Woolworths lingerie ambassador, with her range, Distraction for Bonang, proving to be successful, as it has been going on for years now. We would never be able to count the number of presenting gigs the Queen B has bagged this year alone, with the most recent being the Afrimas in Nigeria, though the most-talked about was the MTV Africa Music Awards after she was announced as Comedian Trevor Noah s replacement. She reportedly bagged R500 000 from the gig. It does not come as a surprise that she owns a Mercedes-AMG CLA45 and an SUV G63.
