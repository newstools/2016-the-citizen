Click here for a live scorecard. 18.02: The Proteas require 5 wickets to win, Sri Lanka 248 runs. The equation is pretty much in the hosts&#8217; favour. That said, the visitors applied themselves much better. SL 240/5 at the close. 17.53: Kyle Abbott &#8220;strikes&#8221; with his first ball of a new spell but Dhananjaya de Silva reviews and Hawk Eye says it&#8217;s missing leg-stump. Good call. SL 231/5. 17.46: South Africa take the new ball. This could be fun. SL 227/5. 17.36: GONE! Poor from Dinesh Chandimal. He had already survived a chance and tries to slog Keshav Maharaj again. No timing and no elevation as Kagiso Rabada snaffles the chance at mid-on. Maharaj has bowled 22 overs on the trot and gets his just reward. SL 225/5. 17.33: He toned down significantly after a quick start but Angelo Mathews reaches a valuable 50 off 93 deliveries. Solid knock. SL 224/4. 17.30: Maharaj has tied up his end well and helping the Proteas get quicker to the second new ball. He&#8217;s deserved better. SL 217/4. 17.07: Dropped! It hasn&#8217;t been the best of days in the field for Stephen Cook. Dinesh Chandimal chances his arm but he totally mistimes a slog over mid-off. The ball bursts right through Cooky&#8217;s hands. He is furious with himself. SL 207/4. 16.42: GONE! Kusal, what are you doing? Kagiso Rabada starts a new spell around the wicket, trying to trap Angelo Mathews with a short ball on the pull. Instead, Mendis makes room and tries to push a bouncer over the keeper. It&#8217;s too quick and he feathers it to Quinton de Kock. SL 193/4. 16.21: Kusal Mendis had the cricketing world talking with his knocks against Australia earlier this year. He&#8217;s doing his reputation no harm with an excellent unbeaten 52 here. SL 183/3. 16.05: Meanwhile, the Mendis-Mathews combo has grown past 50. 16.03: Keshav Maharaj traps Angelo Mathews on the back foot but umpire Bruce Oxenford says not out. South Africa review but the ball doesn&#8217;t turn enough. SL 171/3. 15.54: Promising partnership developing between Kusal Mendis and Angelo Mathews. They take the visitors past 150. Maharaj is causing a few problems though. SL 154/3. 15.25: OUT! Splendid delivery from Kagiso Radaba. It nips back into the obdurate Kaushal Silva and its plumb in front. Silva reviews because he thinks it might be high but it&#8217;s not. Hard work undone. SL 118/3. 14.58: An extended second session comes to an end. Kaushal Silva has shown commendable application in reaching an unbeaten 48. South Africa need some inspiration on what has become a unfriendly surface. SL 118/2. 14.40: Kusal Mendis shows good reactions after a drive from Silva is deflected onto his stumps. Sri Lanka move past 100. 14.13: WICKET! One brings two. Keshav Maharaj bowls a smart over to Kusal Perera, cramping him and tempting him to play on the off-side. This one goes on straight and Perera, trying to cut, gets an edge. SL 93/2. 14.02: GONE! Disaster for the Sri Lankans! The opening pair had been doing so well and then a run out! It seemed like perfectly good quick single but for some reason both Silva and Karunaratne hesitate mid-pitch. JP Duminy is like a hawk and even a dive can&#8217;t save Karunaratne. SL 87/1. 13.26: Close! Keshav Maharaj draws Silva forward and he clips one in the air to Dean Elgar at short midwicket. He gets a hand to it but it&#8217;s a difficult one. Not the type of risks Sri Lanka need now. SL 54/0. 13.25: 50 up for the Sri Lankans. The application of Kaushal Silva and Dimuth Karunaratne has been excellent. 13.12: This is going to be a game of patience. Both sides not giving an inch. It&#8217;s actually pretty decent Test cricket this. SL 42/0. 12.01: Despite Rabada&#8217;s good spell, the Sri Lankans handled themselves competently in an awkward session. The Proteas will now definitely realise some assistance in the pitch has disappeared. SL 27/0 11.48: Kagiso Rabada is looking a bit better in this innings. Bowls a nasty delivery to Kaushal Silva but the diminutive opener&#8217;s hands are s0ft and the catch doesn&#8217;t carry to Quinton de Kock. Lovely ball. SL 21/0. 11.25: Kyle Abbott and Vernon Philander have been miserly in the first six overs. They&#8217;ve only conceded 7 runs. But Kaushal Silva and Dimuth Karunaratne have been patient. 10.47: And the declaration comes. A lead of 487 will be enough, even if Pakistan made a fist of chasing 490 against Australia the other day. 10.44: OUT! Herath gets some reward. De Kock sweeps two balls later but misses. He reviews just for the fun of it yet it&#8217;s stone dead. He&#8217;s out for 69. SA 406/6. 10.43: Rangana Herath gets some purchase out of the rough and traps De Kock on the crease. Bruce Oxenford says not out but Sri Lanka insist on a review. It&#8217;s not a bad one but Hawk Eye says Umpire&#8217;s Call. That dreaded phrase. De Kock survives. SA 406/5. 10.42: The pair stroll past 400. Is the magical declaration number 500? 10.28: And Faf du Plessis reaches the 50 mark too with a whip through midwicket. It&#8217;s taken him 73 deliveries. 10.24: Nothing has changed since last evening. Quinton de Kock reaches his 50 off 66 deliveries and it hasn&#8217;t even been all that attacking. SA 369/5. 10.00: Hashim Amla, according to us, stole some of Stephen Cook&#8217;s thunder on Wednesday. Here&#8217;s why. (Warning: It&#8217;s tongue in cheek!) 9.55: Welcome to day four&#8217;s coverage of the first Test between the Proteas and Sri Lanka. It seems Faf du Plessis is going to bat on because he doesn&#8217;t think there&#8217;ll be too much assistance in the morning for his bowlers.
