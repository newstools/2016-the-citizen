The South African government has welcomed the adoption, on December 23, of United Nations Security Council resolution 2334 condemning the continued settlement activities of Israel in the Palestinian West Bank. The resolution condemns all measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem , International Relations and Co-operation Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane said in a statement. This decision by the security council is long overdue and emphasises the illegal nature of activities undertaken by the government of Israel that include the building of settlement, the confiscation of land, the demolition of Palestinian property and the displacement of Palestinians. Illegal Israeli settlements continued unabated and had led to a fragmentation of the West Bank and continued to threaten the feasibility of a contiguous Palestinian state. The continued settlement activities in fact undermined Israel s immediate and long-term security prospects and contributed to the radicalisation of the region, she said. South Africa reiterates its call for all efforts to kick-start the stalled negotiations and to do so in a balanced manner that will urge the parties to start engaging in the final status issues. South Africa remains committed to providing both sides with support needed to achieve a lasting resolution of the question of Palestine based on all relevant UN resolutions and within the framework of international law.
