Disgruntled former combatants of Umkhontho we Sizwe (MK) are calling on all who have the best interests of military veterans at heart to boycott the Umkhontho we Sizwe Military Veterans&#8217; Association (MKMVA) awards ceremony to decorate &#8220;discredited&#8221; individuals. Notable figures, including embattled SABC executive Hlaudi Motsoeneng, outgoing Eskom CEO Brian Molefe and SAA chairperson Dudu Myeni, are to receive special awards at the ceremony which will be held at Emperors Palace in Ekurhuleni on Thursday. The move by the MKMVA to honour these figures has caused a political storm because of their perceived close relationship with President Jacob Zuma, who will deliver a keynote address at the ceremony. &#8220;As former combatants of MK, we were never consulted on the criteria that opened the way for dubious individuals to be honoured alongside patriots who sacrificed everything, including life and limb,&#8221; former MK combatants spokesperson Archie Mogodiri said on Wednesday. &#8220;If indeed the so-called special category was for genuine reasons, why are more deserving people who have played a role in radical transformation being overlooked?&#8221; READ MORE: PICS: MKMVA inaugural golf day, brought to you by the Guptas Mogodiri said the flimsy excuse that the hand-picked individuals played or are playing a role in transformation is an insult. &#8220;These individuals have a chequered corporate history littered with embarrassing scandals and rampant corruption,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Does lying about your academic qualifications represent transformation?,&#8221; Mogodiri asked in reference to Motsoeneng who was found to have lied about his qualifications. &#8220;Does imposing, without board approval, a dictatorial editorial policy mean transformation?&#8221; Mogodiri said the less was said about Molefe and Myeni, the better as their track records at the state-owned enterprises is something no right-thinking person can be proud of. &#8220;We believe there are other motives other than those being peddled to honour discredited individuals, &#8220;Mogodiri said. &#8220;To even expect former combatants to share a stage with them boggles the mind.&#8221; MKMVA chairperson Kebby Maphatsoe said the association was honouring them for giving a share of procurement to military veterans and for contributing immensely to the radical transformation agenda in this current phase.
