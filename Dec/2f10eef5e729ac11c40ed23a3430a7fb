The Titans&#8217; wobble in the domestic T20 competition continued on Friday night after they slipped to a six-wicket loss against the Warriors in Centurion. Having previously been unbeaten, Mark Boucher&#8217;s charges have now lost two on the trot. The hosts were undone by the wily Andrew Birch, whose clever variations brought him superb figures of 5/16. David Wiese&#8217;s powerful 36 off 28 deliveries was the only score of substance in a Titans innings that was undermined by too many batters wasting useful platforms. Once Jon-Jon Smuts (33) and Colin Ingram (50 off 45) added 68 for the second wicket in just over 8 overs, the Warriors were in control. Colin Ackermann, who&#8217;s rapidly developing into one of franchise cricket&#8217;s most underrated talents, applied the finishing touches with a rapid 53 off only 34 balls. In Kimberley, Reeza Hendricks punished his former teammates as the Highveld Lions kept their playoff hopes alive with a 20-run triumph over the Knights. The 27-year-old opener had just returned from a side strain and had to overcome some poor form to date as well. But those struggles were forgotten as Hendricks played some sumptuous strokes in a superb 53 off 32 deliveries. Nicky van der Bergh was the mainstay in the latter part of the innings as his 57 (35 balls) led the Lions to an imposing 182/5. Despite a promising innings by 21-year-old Leus du Plooy (45 off 33), the Knights were undone left-arm spin of Bjorn Fortuin, who snagged 4/39. &nbsp;
