A Cape Town man has joined the list of millionaires in the region after winning the Lotto Plus jackpot worth R21 664 253 on December 17. Gearing up for an exciting festive season, the lottery player visited Ithuba s offices to claim his winnings, that will change his life forever. The excited family man confessed to Ithuba that he had never thought he would win, as he had been playing the lottery for many years and had never won anything before, though he had always been hopeful. He spent only R30 on his winning Quick Pick ticket at Kenilworth Racing, Retreat Mall, Cape Town. After discovering that he had won, the Lotto Plus winner kept his winning ticket in his wallet and only confided in his son about the windfall. The winner, well in his fifties, said he plans on investing most of the money so he is able to provide a better future for his children. Education is important to me and with these winnings, I will be able to provide the best education for my children , he said. He is also planning towards his retirement, and has always had a dream of running his own business. You have no idea what a huge difference this will make to my life and that of my family, he said. Ithuba s Zukiswa Nomnganga said they provided the winner with financial counselling. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
