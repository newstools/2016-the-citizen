Forum 4 Service Delivery (F4SD) councillor in Rustenburg Pogiso Bothomane is prepared to pay money due to the civic movement, he said on Wednesday. I have written a letter to the Forum [F4SD] indicating that I will start to contribute in January. I will pay the R2 000 and R3 000 next year. I am still a member of the Forum and a councillor, he said. He said his lawyer had written to the F4SD explaining his situation. Bothomane revealed at the memorial of the late veteran politician Rocky Malebana-Metsing, that he, together with Malebana-Metsing, had been given final warning notices and ordered to pay a fine amounting to R5 000 by November 30 or face expulsion from the party. His comments triggered a public spat between him and F4SD national convener Mbahare Kekana. Kekana said Bothomane did not want to contribute to the growth of the F4SD, had always acted inconsistent with the directions of the F4SD and was not even a member in good standing. Mr Bothomane, for instance, was given until 30 November 2016 to fix his membership in line with the F4SD constitution and to stop doing as he pleases. He is expected to pay up the arrears he owes towards the Rustenburg constituency office and a fine imposed to him said Kekana at the time. Kekana declined to comment on the membership standing of Bothomane, stating that internal process were unfolding. The issue of [Mr] Pogiso Bothomane and the F4SD is still unfolding internally. Communication will be disseminated in due course.
