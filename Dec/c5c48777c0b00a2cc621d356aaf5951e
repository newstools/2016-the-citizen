Once the most powerful man in football, Blatter is serving a ban over ethics violations relating to a suspect $2 million payment he authorised in 2011 to former UEFA boss Michel Platini. The 80-year-old Swiss served as FIFA chief from 1998 to 2015. Both Blatter and Platini were originally banned for eight years by the sport&#8217;s world governing body, but that was reduced to six years by a FIFA appeals panel in February. Platini had his ban cut by a further two years by CAS in May. The result of Blatter&#8217;s appeal will be made public at 1400 GMT (1500 local time) on Monday. A CAS statement confirmed: &#8220;The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) will issue its decision in the arbitration procedure between Joseph S Blatter and the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) at 3.00pm (Swiss time) on Monday, December 5 2016.&#8221;
