Twitter has been dragging The Queen actor and Desmond Tutu&#8217;s granddaughter, Natasha Thahane, and it is not looking good. What is shocking is that she is being attacked over something she said on Twitter in September! Now we know the Twitterati does not forgive and forget. Thahane used to post pictures of herself with her then boyfriend Bo Maq (real name Bohlale Makgolane) and wrote sweet captions, and their love was envied by many. When she stopped posting about him, her fans started wondering if they had broken up. Twitter user @JustKholii_ was one of those fans who were wondering about her love life and even took to Twitter to ask his 18.2K followers if the two were still together. http://twitter.com/JustKholii_/status/807107987223539712 One of his followers responded and said they had heard that she was dating rapper A-reece (real name Lehlogonolo Ronald Mataboge). Thahane saw the thread and said: &#8220;Apparently she&#8217;s single now&#8230; Soooo does this conversation make us richer now? *checks bank balance* [sic],&#8221; a tweet that has earned her the number one spot on the Twitter trends list. http://twitter.com/JustKholii_/status/807114950548275200 @JustKholii_ says Thahane was wrong to have brought up bank balances when she could have just ignored the tweet and says celebrities should learn to keep their relationships off social media if they do not want their fans to ask about it. &#8220;If you post Instagram photos and delete them. We can ALL see that happen. I am going to ask questions. &#8220;If you post your relationship shandis on social media and make it well-known to the public. Don&#8217;t tell me to stay out of that business,&#8221; he said. #NatashaThahane Always plays &#39;those innocent&#39; virgin characters. Show writers should give her a role that suits her true kak personality. &mdash; TweetGuru (@JustKholii_) December 9, 2016 He said he vowed that day to start a trend that would expose celebrities who let fame change them, further saying the characters she played on TV did not suit her &#8220;k*k&#8221; personality. Thahane saw the negative tweets and opted to pray for those who were dragging her. &#8220;Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Ignore the hate! Ignore the fake! Ignore the funny shi*!!!!
