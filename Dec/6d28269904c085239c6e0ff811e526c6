Stokvel-related robberies and thefts are the most prevalent during the festive season, according to KwaZulu-Natal police, and members of such clubs are urged to adopt reasonable measures to safeguard their money. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele has urged members of such clubs to rather transfer the money into their members&#8217; bank accounts than to withdraw large amounts of cash from banks for their members. This advice was seconded by Riaan Appelgrein, senior manager of customer financial solutions at Standard Bank, who warned that criminals would be ready to pounce on unsuspecting customers who were drawing large sums of cash. &#8220;It s possible for you not to be a victim be smart by taking some precautions listed below to ensure that you protect your hard-earned savings,&#8221; said Appelgrein. He further advised that stokvel customers make their calculations ahead of time and that their local bank branches could arrange for payments to be made directly into individual members&#8217; accounts. &#8220;All you need to do is provide the branch with a list of payments to be made and the bank details of the members, and your bank will do the rest. Your bank can also arrange for someone to visit your stokvel to open bank accounts for those members who do not have accounts,&#8221; Appelgrein advised. He further counselled that bank branches could make payments directly to retailers and would be provided with a proof of payment, or alternatively, the bank could provide bank guaranteed cheques that can then be drawn for a specific beneficiary. The police also believed that paying members in cash was an &#8220;inadvisable&#8221; practice, but advised members who do so to ensure that they have a secure venue with adequate safety measures in place when dividing up the year&#8217;s savings. &#8220;Stokvel clubs can also request their local police to patrol the vicinity of the venue where they are to make payments to their members as this would deter criminal elements,&#8221; Mbhele said. He further added that members of stokvels should take precautions to safeguard their money when withdrawing from ATMs and advised that they should not withdraw large amounts of money, especially after hours. &#8220;Rather use the ATMs at shopping malls during business hours when it is safer or where there are security officials on duty,&#8221; said Mbhele. Appelgrein added that people should not advertise their plans to visit a bank and should make sure that are not followed when going to and leaving the bank. &#8220;Stagger withdrawals into smaller amounts over different days. This way, you won t lose all your cash at once should you be the victim of a crime,&#8221; advised Appelgrein, adding that stokvel members should avoid visiting the bank on &#8220;high-risk days&#8221;, which he said were Mondays, Fridays or just after month-end.
