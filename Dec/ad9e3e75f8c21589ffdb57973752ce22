Alviro Petersen, one of the last pieces of Cricket South Africa&#8217;s (CSA) match-fixing puzzle, has been granted a reprieve to respond to the charges brought against him. The former Proteas opening batsman was sanctioned last month for his alleged involvement in last year&#8217;s corruption scandal during the domestic T20 competition despite stating in March that he had been the whistleblower that alerted CSA&#8217;s anti-corruption and security unit (ASCU) about the illicit activities. Petersen initially had two weeks to prepare a legal defence but his lawyer, Robin Twaddle, confirmed to ESPNCricinfo that the local governing body had granted an extension till Friday. Gulam Bodi, a former Proteas limited overs batsman, was banned for 20 years from all cricket-related activities after admitting to being the middleman between the involved players and an international betting syndicate. In August, Thami Tsolekile, Jean Symes, Pume Matshikwe (all Highveld Lions) and Ethy Mbhalati (Titans) were all banned for their involvement. The Citizen had previously confirmed from various sources that the case against Petersen has been a tricky one, especially given that he had alerted the relevant authorities. But Petersen only did so two days after his last meeting with Bodi, which contravenes CSA&#8217;s code of conduct for players. It states a player must immediately report a suspicious approach to a designated ASCU official. Petersen maintains he was &#8220;merely playing along&#8221; in order to not arouse any suspicion from the relevant betting role-players and claims one prominent player, who was also involved, hasn&#8217;t been charged. CSA has consistently maintained they will not comment on the on-going investigation.
