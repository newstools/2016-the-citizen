Dar es Salaam. Barclays Bank Tanzania has launched an initiative that seeks to train 3,000 graduates on work and entrepreneurship skills.The three-year ready to work programme will offer workshops and drop-in advice services for young people aged 15 to35 online to support the graduates becoming competitive in the job market as well as getting entrepreneurship tips, the bank said in a statement yesterday.The initiative has been launched in eight higher learning institutions and will be extended to cover 3,000 graduates in other institutions across the country. A good number of young people across the country have told us they don t feel employable, and feel uncertain, lack confidence and are not getting the support and advice they need.Barclays has heard their cry and is here to offer them a support they need, said Barclays Bank Marketing Manager Joe Bendera.
