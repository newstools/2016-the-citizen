Former Benoni resident Keara Lydon, 18, is making waves abroad after recently being crowned the Most Beautiful Girl in Ireland (MBGI), reports the Benoni City Times. My mom, Karen Lydon, thought it would be a great idea to enter the competition, as I ve never entered a pageant before, Lydon said. Lydon was crowned the Most Beautiful Girl in Ireland 2016/17 at the Limerick Strand Hotel on November 25. She ll leave for Dubai to represent Ireland in the Most Beautiful Girl in the World competition in January 2017. Not only is she the 2016/2017 winner of Ireland s most beautiful girl competition, she s also an ambassador for Gosh Copenhagen. Lydon was born in Benoni and grew up in Rynfield and Farrarmere, but moved abroad four years ago. I attended Rynfield Primary School until Grade 2 and Kathstan College until Grade 7, the beauty said. I moved to Ireland over a year ago, but we previously lived in Dubai for three years, as my dad, Michael Lydon, received a job offer in Dublin. Although the teen is making waves abroad, she still considers Benoni her home. Benoni is home. It s where all my friends and family are, and when I was there last year, it felt like I have never left, Lydon added. Suzzie O Deniyi, director of MBGI, said she s looking forward to seeing how the 18-year-old will make use of her title. Our aim is to find that one girl who s beautiful inside and out which Keara is, O Deniyi said. It s not just about the beauty but how she uses the title to promote and create awareness of body confidence. The competition consisted of 300 applicants, which was broken down to 12 finalists. Keara is very passionate about animals and hopes to use her title to create awareness of animal cruelty among other things, said O Deniyi.
