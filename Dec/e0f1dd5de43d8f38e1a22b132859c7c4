A man died and another was seriously injured when a truck crashed on the R700 about 20km south of Bultfontein in the Free State on Saturday night, paramedics said. Various services responded from both Bloemfontein and Welkom, as well as Theunissen, Stanley Schimper of Trauma Response Africa said in a statement on the Arrive Alive website on Sunday. On arrival it was found that a goods truck had left the road and overturned. Rescuers assessed the scene and found that two people were trapped in the wreckage. One had sadly already passed away and the other was alive and talking to emergency workers. However, only his face was visible at the time, with the rest of his body severely entrapped in the mangled wreckage. Treatment was started by paramedics on scene to keep him as comfortable as possible while being extricated. This, however, turned out to be a mammoth task with hardly any space to work in. Rescuers continued regardless and at times worked with three different sets of rescue equipment at various positions on the wreckage. The patient was freed from the wreckage after being trapped for more than four hours in a serious but stable condition. Once free, he was further stabilised by paramedics on scene before he was transported to Pelonomi Hospital in Bloemfontein for further care. This operation would not have been possible if it was not for the selfless effort and incredible teamwork by all on scene, regardless from which service, Schimper said.
