Thousands of newly trained policemen and women are expected to be spread out across the country, where they will be performing operational duties for the next 12 months. 4 900 recruits successfully completed the Basic Police Development Programme at South African Police Service (SAPS) Basic Training Academies across the country. Eastern Cape police spokesperson Colonel Sibongile Soci said the newly trained constables were now being deployed at police stations, which forms part of their practical, in-service training. Crowd management has been included in the Basic Training curriculum to equip the new members to manage crowds as the first responders to protest actions, said Soci. SAPS is confident that its new members are well trained, ready to serve and to protect all in South Africa, especially during the busy festive season. These members will soon join the rest of the SAPS members, who have already been operationally deployed, as part of the Safer Festive Season Campaign in line with the back-to-basics operational plan. A passing-out parade was held on Friday in Bisho, and the Eastern Cape SAPS has welcomed the 570 new constables. As many as 142 recruits were deployed in Nelson Mandela Bay, 40 in Graaff-Reinet, 278 in East London 29 at Humansdorp and 110 in Mthatha.
