by Ian WHITTELL Arsenal manager Wenger, defeated for just the second time this season, blamed referee Mark Clattenburg for awarding the first of a series of corners from which Ashley Williams headed in the 86th-minute winner. But Koeman responded bullishly and claimed he had targeted Arsenal&#8217;s weak points by instructing his players to adopt an aggressive approach against the Premier League title hopefuls. &#8220;I&#8217;m not surprised about Wenger&#8217;s comments because it is the third time in a row that I won as a manager at home against Arsenal,&#8221; said the Everton manager after Tuesday&#8217;s game. &#8220;And that is three times in a row that it was about the referee. OK, sorry Arsenal. We won through the referee tonight, sorry! &#8220;Their weakness is if you go face-to-face and win battles and you run and you go. Then you need a bit of luck and we deserved that. &#8220;If you fight for every ball and are aggressive, you see the reaction of the crowd and with a lot of aggression, you can make life difficult. Then it is really difficult to beat Everton here. &#8220;We showed that after 20 minutes. We went face-to-face against them and that&#8217;s what you have to do against teams like Arsenal.&#8221; Williams struck from Ross Barkley&#8217;s corner after Alexis Sanchez&#8217;s 20th-minute opener for Arsenal, a deflected free-kick, had been cancelled out by Seamus Coleman&#8217;s 44th-minute header. Citing Clattenburg&#8217;s decision to award a corner despite the ball appearing to have gone out off Everton substitute Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Wenger said his side had been hard done by. &#8220;Of course it was not a corner,&#8221; said Wenger. &#8220;It was the wrong decision. &#8220;You could see from outside that it was no corner. I&#8217;m very disappointed because Clattenburg was in a very good position to see the player had the ball out. &#8220;It is not the first time we are unlucky with his decision this season. But overall I don&#8217;t want to speak about the referee too much.&#8221; &#8211; Half-time hassle &#8211; The high stakes, with Everton looking to end a five-game winless run and Arsenal seeking a win that would have taken them to the top of the table, spilled over at half-time as the teams left the field. Rival players exchanged words and traded pushes, with James McCarthy seeming to accost Arsenal playmaker Mesut Ozil. &#8220;I was close to it and didn&#8217;t see a lot there,&#8221; said Wenger. &#8220;A little bit of pushing, but nothing dramatic.&#8221; Wenger also insisted his players had not frozen on a big occasion and with a fervent Goodison crowd growing ever more vocal as the game progressed. &#8220;No,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We were a little bit less fresh and maybe we lost a little bit of urgency when we were 1-0 up and perfectly in control of the game. &#8220;We are used to playing away at places like this and when you play nine months away from home unbeaten, then you have that normally every week. &#8220;They made the game physical, they defended well, they played a cup game and made a big difference from what I had seen from them, the past few weeks. &#8220;They fought for every ball. I don&#8217;t think they can repeat that every single game.&#8221; Everton will have to do that in their next game, the home Merseyside derby with Liverpool on Monday, and Koeman said the victory was perfect preparation. &#8220;Of course now it is a totally different situation to go into Monday,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have three points in the pocket, a good performance and we know we are very strong at home. &#8220;We are still unbeaten at home. We know everything about the Merseyside derby and if we play with the passion we showed tonight (Tuesday), we can have a good result.&#8221;
