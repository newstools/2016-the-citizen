The local Cape Town chapter of Chinese charity organisation Soong Ching Ling made donations to orphaned children at the Baphumelele Children s Home in Khayelitsha on Saturday. Soong Ching Ling Foundation chairperson Qing Chen said the organisation was established in 1936 in China. Today, the foundation could be seen making a difference all over the world. . The foundation consists of about 15 dedicated volunteers in Cape Town who use their own money to make donations to the Baphumelele Children s Home twice a year. Last year, the foundation donated a R2.3 million facility named China House which could host 18 teenage orphans before having to adapt to society. Saturday s donations included daily necessities that would support the children, staff, and management for six months. Rosie Mashale, also known as mama, who founded the children s home in 1989, received the donations which included, 10kg bags of sugar, rice, canned goods, sauces, vegetables, onions, potatoes, oil, cereal, and powdered milk. People s Republic of China Consul General in Cape Town Kang Yong thanked the staff and teachers for dedicating their time to the children and serving their country. We all want you to have a happy festive season and we will be here now and in the future to help you. We will continue to develop the good relationship and friendship between China and South Africa, Yong said. . Mama Mashale could not express her gratitude enough. She thanked the foundation for always supporting the children s home. You surprise me each and every year. Thanks for bringing Christmas early this year, we are eternally grateful, she said. After opening their Christmas party bags, the children smiled brightly and sang a song of thanks for the Soong Ching Ling Foundation.
