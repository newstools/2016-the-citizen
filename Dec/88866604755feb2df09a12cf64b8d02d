Radio 702, in an interview with the SA Police Union (Sapu), heard that a reported 22 full-time VIP bodyguards protecting President Jacob Zuma may be overly excessive. Reports have counted nearly two-dozen men guarding Zuma at any given moment, with some of the men dressed like him (of late) and apparently made to look like him. Former leader of Iraq Saddam Hussein was also well known for surrounding himself with a large group of lookalikes, making it harder for any assassin to kill him. The Midday Report spoke to Mpho Kwinika, the president of Sapu, who agreed that the president should be protected, but it would simply cost too much and evidently probably be unnecessary to have such a large squad, since no &#8220;tangible threats to his safety &#8230; warrant such a large VIP security team&#8221;. &#8220;We were also very shocked to learn, not only about his own guard has increased, but his budget the budget of that unit has increased as well,&#8221; he said on radio. He then lamented that the police service was struggling with budgetary restrictions and it would be far better to allocate the money to the better resourcing of the men and women in blue.
