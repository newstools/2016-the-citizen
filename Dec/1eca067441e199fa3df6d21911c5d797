Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) spokesman Simon Zwane said the 28-year-old man was arrested on Monday in Tembisa. He offered R250 to a member of the national traffic police to avoid having his unroadworthy motor vehicle discontinued. The officer was in the process of removing the car s licence when the motorist offered him the money. The Nissan 1400 light delivery vehicle was found to have worn-out tyres without functioning headlights and brake lights. At least three motorists have been arrested on allegations of bribery since the start of the festive season. Two were arrested in the Eastern Cape, said Zwane. Police would continue to monitor roads as holidaymakers make their way back to provinces such as Gauteng. On Tuesday, the RTMC said more than 7 000 drivers had been arrested so far for various offences including drunken driving, speeding and reckless and negligent driving. More than 13 000 received fines for failing to wear seat belts and using cellphones while driving. African News Agency (ANA)
