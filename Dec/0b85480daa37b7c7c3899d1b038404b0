When Theunis de Bruyn arrives at the Proteas camp as the only new cap in the Test squad against Sri Lanka, he won&#8217;t be quiet. Pierre de Bruyn, his unrelated mentor and current coach of English county Leicestershire, can assure you of that. &#8220;Theunis is sometimes misunderstood,&#8221; says the former Tuks coach, who was intimately involved in the 24-year-old&#8217;s development as player. &#8220;He has never been a guy who&#8217;ll accept certain ideas at face-value. He&#8217;s someone who wants to debate issues constructively. I personally enjoy it when my players challenge my ideas but I know it brings him into to conflict with other coaches.&#8221; Yet the Knights captain doesn&#8217;t do so because he&#8217;s a troublemaker. Also read: Powerful Theunis de Bruyn becomes a Protea &#8220;Theunis has a thirst for knowledge. He tries to process every little thing he learns because he believes it makes him a better player,&#8221; says De Bruyn. &#8220;It also explains why the Knights decided to make him their captain at a relatively young age. Theunis is an interesting thinker on the game.&#8221; Despite owing his inclusion to AB de Villiers and Rilee Rossouw&#8217;s injuries, not many will complain about him being granted an opportunity. De Bruyn has scored 423 runs at 60.42 to date in this year&#8217;s domestic first-class competition and is one of few domestic batsmen currently who look capable of being successful in international cricket. In fact, the former national Under-19 player is truly gifted. He smashed 108 off 90 balls on his domestic one-day debut for the Titans and grabbed headlines in early 2015 when he made 202* and 161 in a unofficial Test series between South Africa &#8216;A&#8217; and a very strong England Lions side. But last season&#8217;s struggles at the Titans brought back memories of the false start to his senior career. De Bruyn played in the same SA Under-19 side as Quinton de Kock in 2012 before a hip operation yanked him out of the system for two years. &#8220;People underestimate what a difficult situation that is,&#8221; says Pierre. &#8220;You&#8217;re on the radar but you sort of need to keep reminding people who you are. Theunis&#8217; injury meant he just disappeared and had to work really hard to get back.&#8221; Ironically, his &#8220;comeback&#8221; was dramatic. De Bruyn was picked out of the blue for his Titans T20 debut before he even played a first-class game and whacked an unbeaten 53. &#8220;That sums him up. You think Theunis relies solely on his talent to get somewhere but that couldn&#8217;t be further from the truth,&#8221; says Pierre. &#8220;He works immensely hard and constantly tries to improve. I&#8217;m really proud of him.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
