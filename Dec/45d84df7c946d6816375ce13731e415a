Murder accused Mark Zinde is expected to appear in the Vereeniging Magistrate s Court on Thursday, facing a charge of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm. Zinde, 23, allegedly attacked his father, Dr Lebohang Mohale Manoto, with a glass on November 6. Manoto was reading a newspaper at his home in Walkerville south of Johannesburg when his son allegedly struck him with the glass in his face. His father took him in after he was released on bail in Brits, North West for allegedly killing his mother Hope Zinde, 50. He allegedly killed his mother, a former journalist and SABC board member, in June at her home in Pecanwood outside Brits. His R10 000 bail on the murder charge was revoked on December 19, for not adhering to his bail conditions. The Vereeniging case was expected to be postponed to next year, as the defence intends applying for him to go undergo psychiatric observation at Weskoppies Psychiatric Hospital in Pretoria. He was previously admitted to Weskoppies for psychiatric assessment and found to be fit to stand trial and capable of understanding court proceedings. The report further stated that he did not suffer from any mental disorder when he allegedly killed his mother. The defence is disputing the psychiatric report and wants him to be re-admitted and re-evaluated. He was expected to appear in the Brits Magistrate s Court in January, where an application for admission at Weskoppies would be made. African News Agency (ANA)
