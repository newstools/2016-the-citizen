Four men have been taken in for questioning in connection with the murder of local Chief Linda Mathonsi and attempted murder of his daughter, the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) in KwaZulu-Natal said on Tuesday. Mathonsi was gunned down by unknown assailants while driving with his daughter, who was also shot on the arm, at Chappies area near the Sundumbili Library in Mandeni, KwaZulu-Natal, earlier this month. He was shot in the head and neck and died on the scene while his daughter was rushed to hospital. The suspects fled the scene. The murder sparked outrage and thousands of people attended the funeral of the Inkosi at the Sundumbili Sports Grounds on Saturday. The case docket had meanwhile been transferred to the Hawks which announced on Tuesday that four suspects had been apprehended. One of the men was found in possession of a firearm. The firearm was seized and will be sent for ballistic testing to establish if it was used in the commission of crime, Hawks spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said. According to MEC for the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta), Nomusa Dube-Ncube, Mathonsi s death had left a big void in the institution of traditional leadership, especially in his community.
