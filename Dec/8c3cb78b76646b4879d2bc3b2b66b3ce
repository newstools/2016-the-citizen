The children s ward at the Bertha Gxowa hospital in Germiston in Ekurhuleni on Friday was lit up with jubilation. This after the City of Ekurhuleni first lady Sinazo Masina, her husband, mayor Mzwandile Masina, former miss South Africa Bokang Tshabalala and her husband, Kaizer Chiefs midfielder, Siphiwe Tshabalala, handed Christmas goodies to the children at the ward. They visited children in a paediatric ward, chatting to them in a bid to make them feel the joy and spirit of Christmas. Sinazo said they visited the hospital because they are passionate about social responsibility. Imagine a kid without a family stuck in hospital. We are happy to be here. It would be great to come back, Sinazo said. Bokang said it is horrible being a mom knowing that your child is in hospital.

In one of the wards, the mood was a bit tense when one of the children started crying when the entourage entered the ward. His mother was sitting next to his bed feeding him. But in a memorable moment, Sinazo took the boy in her arms and managed to pacify him. She apologised to him for disturbing his lunch. She then handed him a Christmas pack with some toys. Siphiwe shook hands with the boy, saying: My name is Siphiwe Tshabalala. There was a smile on the boy s face after Siphiwe had introduced himself.
