African Business magazine said on Tuesday that the World Bank Group tops this year s ranking in its annual Employer of Choice survey. The survey is based on a range of criteria that rank companies and institutions from the perspective of employees, the pan-African business magazine said in a statement. The collaboration with recruitment and career specialists Careers in Africa and global HR consultants Willis Towers Watson collated responses to 100 questions from more than 20,000 graduates and employees this year. This year s study ranks the World Bank Group as the strongest employer brand in terms of employer value proposition. At a difficult time for the oil and gas industry globally two companies from that sector take the second and third positions, Exxon Mobil and Chevron respectively. Sarah Roe, co-founder of the Global Career Company and an African recruitment specialist, says that making an impact was now a key attraction for prospective employees. In essence, she adds, the number one retention driver for African talent is buying into really good leadership, belief in the business and really feeling that they are part of something worthwhile . In recent times, Roe says, there have been significant changes in the recruitment space in Africa, most notably reverse brain drain and greater demand for pan-African experience. Also, work-life balance and social impact have become as important to employees as financial reward.
