Mpumalanga MEC for Human Settlements Speedy Mashilo on Thursday urged members of the ANC not to carry white dolls at the court trial of the two white men accused of assaulting a black man and shoving him into a coffin. Mashilo said this shortly after Theo Martins Jackson and Willem Oosthuizen were denied bail in the Middelburg Magistrate s Court. They were arrested for allegedly assaulting and shoving Victor Rethabile Mlotshwa into a coffin. A group of African National Congress members on Friday slapped the two white dolls with their hands outside the same court that were tied up onto a wood plank. The crowd said the dolls were the replicas of the accused. Addressing a crowd of ANC, ANC Women s League and the South African Communist Party outside the court on Thursday, Mashilo said it was wrong for ANC members to regard every white person in this country as a racist. He thanked Magistrate Jongilizwe Dumehleli for the manner in which he presided over the bail hearing. The magistrate also said not all white people are racists, said Mashilo, who was speaking in his capacity as Nkangala regional chairperson of the ANC. We are happy the magistrates are listening to us. They [accused] will spend Christmas in jail but jail is better than a coffin. Mashilo pointed at a male ANC member in the crowd, who was carrying the two dolls, and ordered him to put them down. The man complied. Addressing the same crowd earlier, Mpumalanga secretary of the Congress of SA Trade Unions (Cosatu), Thabo Mokoena said the federation would not rest until the accused were found guilty and given long jail sentences. As Cosatu, we feel vindicated, said Mokoena. We pity those who sleep with racists. We are saying to them: you are fools. The matter was postponed to January 25.
