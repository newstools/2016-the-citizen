It is a sad commentary on the way sport at international level is conducted in this country that two of our national teams could conceivably be without a guiding hand early in the new year. Shakes Mashaba, admittedly one of the more passionate and combustible characters in South African football, made up the first half of the equation when he was summarily fired by this country s ruling soccer body, Safa, as Bafana Bafana coach on Thursday.

It is not for us to comment on the outcome of the hearing, chaired by an independent legal expert over five days on December 5-7, 9 and 12, other than to offer that egos as much as performance seem to have played a major part in the final decision. A similar fate might well await national rugby coach Allister Coetzee towards the end of January when he has to account to the powers that be within the South African game on a season that rates as the worst internationally in professional Springbok history. It is no secret that across the globe, spanning the full dimension of sporting codes, it is the coaches, more often than not, who take the blame for failure and very seldom the panels which put them there. This is a fact of sporting realpolitik which, unless they are exceptionally naive and should arguably not have been put there in the first place, coaches are aware of. But, with the sacking of the coach coming as it does on the very eve of Christmas, it does not place Safa in an exceptionally favourable light. Perhaps their communications policy should also come under review. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
