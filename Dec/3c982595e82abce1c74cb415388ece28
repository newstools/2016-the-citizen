A former employee of the uMngeni SPCA in Howick, KwaZulu-Natal, was arrested on Thursday and will face criminal charges relating to the theft of about R321 000. This is according to the National Council of SPCAs (NSPCA), which issued a statement on Friday that described how a warrant of arrest had been issued for the woman and was executed on her return from Italy. The NSPCA stressed that the money in question was taken by the SPCA s former employee prior to it reaching the SPCA. &#8220;That is, funding and donations handed over intended to assist the SPCA were simply not received by the organisation. Income meant for the SPCA was unreceipted and paid directly into the former employee s bank account,&#8221; read the NSPCA&#8217;s statement. Chairperson Dave Taylor advised that even if the full amount in question were to be paid to the SPCA, criminal charges would not be dropped. &#8220;It is extremely serious, unethical and downright dishonest when funds meant for animals are taken unlawfully.&#8221; According the the NSPCA&#8217;s statement, the uMngeni SPCA had been transparent on the matter and had issued a media statement on November 16 when information came to light. &#8220;Donors are thanked for consequently coming forward with information of funds that were not paid directly into the bank account of the Society,&#8221; said the NSPCA. Marcelle Meredith, executive director of the NSPCA, expressed special thanks to Taylor &#8220;for taking the necessary action to determine facts, take decisive action and deal with the corrupt individual appropriately through our judicial system&#8221;. The NSPCA said the SPCA movement prides itself on being a welfare organisation which, by law, must have its financials audited and signed off by registered auditors. &#8220;All SPCAs in South Africa are bound by the SPCA Act No 169 of 1993 that governs its activities,&#8221; concluded the statement.
