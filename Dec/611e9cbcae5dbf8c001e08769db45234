Just before goalkeepers start becoming a tad overconfident after Baroka FC&#8217;s Oscarine Masuluke&#8217;s spectacular goal last week, the example of Miguel Angel Pinto will keep them grounded. The O&#8217;Higgins shot-stopper was on the receiving end at the weekend of a magnificent goal by Alejandro Camargo during his side&#8217;s Chilean Premier League encounter against Universidad de Concepcion. Pinto drifted far out of his goal area in the hope of speeding up the game but his kick barely cleared the centre circle. That was a bad mistake as he would find out in a flash. http://citizen.co.za/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2016/12/videoplayback.mp4
