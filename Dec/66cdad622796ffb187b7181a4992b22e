The Sepp Blatter era of dominance in world football officially ended in sports highest tribunal this week, effectively ending the 17-year-long reign of the slickly suave Swiss. Blatter s rise to power as head of world football body Fifa was built on a complex, intertwined web of grace and favour dispensed from his office at Fifa House in Zurich, a network which encompassed any string which could or might be drawn towards the middle to advance his ambitions and feed his ego. It was his desire to draw a former head of the powerful European ruling body, Michel Platini, closer to him that doubtless led Blatter to have made a 1.3 million disloyal payment to Platini. Both denied wrongdoing as Fifa s slimy underbelly was exposed and head after corrupt head rolled worldwide. Blatter and Platini both received eight-year bans. Blatter appealed but the Court of Arbitration for Sport has now ruled against him. It is finally over. In reality, the fall of Blatter had less to do with the game he publicly declared to serve, than it was about self-seeking and the well documented historical fact that those who often tend to count themselves above the law, very often fall foul to this self-disillusion.
