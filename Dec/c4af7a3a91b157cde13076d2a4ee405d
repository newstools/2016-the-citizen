Mourinho, 53, signed a three-year contract when he succeeded Louis van Gaal as United manager in July. Several British newspapers reported United were already considering offering Mourinho a new deal, but he said the stories were news to him. &#8220;They didn&#8217;t (offer a new contract) and I&#8217;m not expecting them to, because they gave me a three-year contract and were being super supportive,&#8221; he told Sky Sports News. &#8220;They always gave me the feeling three years was not the time I was going to stay and I got the feeling I was going to stay for more time. &#8220;They know if one day they bring the contract I will sign, because I love it here.&#8221; Asked whether a mega-money move to the Chinese Super League might appeal to him, he said: &#8220;China money is attractive for everyone, but I love more my football at the highest level. &#8220;I&#8217;m too young, 53, (have) too many years of football to go to a place like China. I want to stay in the place where it is most difficult to win.&#8221; United have been strongly linked with a January move for Benfica&#8217;s Swedish centre-back Victor Lindelof. Mourinho refused to be drawn on the reports, but said he would not bring in more than one new player. &#8220;Let&#8217;s see what happens,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If we buy a player we buy a player, but we are not buying two, three or four.&#8221; Out-of-favour pair Morgan Schneiderlin and Memphis Depay have both been linked with Everton. But Mourinho said he was happy with his squad, adding: &#8220;If we open the door for someone to leave, it is not because we push him, but because he wants to leave.&#8221;
