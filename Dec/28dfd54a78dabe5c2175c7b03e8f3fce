Zsa Zsa Gabor, the Hungarian-born Hollywood siren perhaps better known for her prodigious love life than her movie credits, died on Sunday after suffering a heart attack, her husband said. She was 99. An emotional Frederic von Anhalt said Gabor had passed away at home surrounded by friends and family. Everybody was there. She didn t die alone, he told AFP by telephone, choking back sobs. The pair married in 1986, making it her longest marriage. Gabor was a voluptuous former beauty queen with a penchant for lame gowns that accentuated her hourglass curves. Her resume includes a long list of film roles in hit movies such as Moulin Rouge, Lili and Arriverderci Baby. But the actress was at least as famous for her conquests between the sheets as her triumphs on the silver screen. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
