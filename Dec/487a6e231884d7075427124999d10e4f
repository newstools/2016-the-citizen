It is officially over for open admirer Cassper Nyovest, as Minenhle Dlamini has announced her engagement. Taking to Instagram on Monday, she posted a picture of her left hand with a diamond ring on her finger and wrote: &#8220;I said yes&#8221;. &#x1f48e; &#x1f37e;&#x1f60d; I said yes &#x1f60a; A photo posted by Minnie (@minniedlamini) on Dec 12, 2016 at 2:14am PST Though she has not confirmed who her new man is, rumour has it that Quinton Jones is the man behind that diamond rock on the model&#8217;s left finger after they were spotted looking rather cosy at the Delicious Festival in October. Earlier this year, she opened up about her new bae in an interview with Gareth Cliff on Cliff Central. Without revealing his name, she said he was someone she had known for a long time. Her bae was someone who has been one of her best friends for a long time, and somewhere along the way, she decided &#8220;to move from being friends to being lovers&#8221;. All we know for sure is that he spoils her, as she told Anele Mdoda on Real Talk. He spoils me a lot, he cooks for me, he brings me breakfast in bed and does cute things for me. From my perspective, it s nice to be taken care of for the first time in a long time, she said.

Now we know he has his stamp of approval, as she is officially off the market. Congratulations MaDlamini! We wish you all the best.
