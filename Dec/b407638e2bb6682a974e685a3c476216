The instinctive skills of Seabelo Senatla and Rosco Speckman were telling as the Blitzboks maintained their unbeaten start to the Dubai Sevens tournament with a hard-fought 21-5 victory over Scotland. Clearly still spooked by the sides&#8217; previous encounter &#8211; when the Scots shocked South Africa in the final of last season&#8217;s London tournament &#8211; Neil Powell&#8217;s charges struggled to find their rhythm in the first half. They relied solely on staunch defence as well as some disruptive tactics at the breakdowns. The Scots, however, finally made their momentum count when the veteran James Fleming beat Senatla down the left touchline to dot down in the corner. But South Africa gained a vital foothole early after the break when Fraser Lyle was yellow-carded for a professional foul. They made the extra man count, with Senatla running a superb line to score his third try in two matches. Shortly thereafter, Justin Geduld &#8211; sporting colourful and unique dreadlocks &#8211; made an immediate impact after coming off the bench. His superb chip in midfield was gleefully picked up by Rosco Speckman, who found just enough space in the in-goal area to touch down. Speckman&#8217;s splendid tackle on the rampaging Jamie Farndale also stopped a dangerous counterattack in its tracks, eventually leading to Senatla&#8217;s second try. The Blitzboks beat Uganda 46-0 in their first pool game. Point-scorers: Blitzboks &#8211; Tries: Seabelo Senatla (2), Rosco Speckman. Conversions: Justin Geduld (2), Cecil Afrika. Scotland &#8211; Try: James Fleming.
