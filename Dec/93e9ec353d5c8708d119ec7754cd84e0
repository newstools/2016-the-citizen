It is now almost three weeks since the South African Football Association (Safa) announced the suspension of Bafana Bafana head coach Shakes Mashaba. Despite Safa CEO Dennis Mumble s claim that the matter would be resolved quickly, it has gone absolutely nowhere, with a postponement on Thursday of a disciplinary hearing. Mashaba has been given more time to prepare his defence what he will say about the regrettable incident at Peter Mokaba Stadium on November 12 that led to his suspension remains to be seen. Yet it will be surprising if whatever he says is enough to keep him in his job. Safa president Danny Jordaan has given little indication that Mashaba has his backing in recent months, openly criticising the team for their failure to make it to the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations. The irony now is that Mashaba seems to have shot himself in the foot from a position of strength, having beaten Senegal in 2018 Fifa World Cup qualifying. For Safa, the longer this incident drags on, the more incompetent they appear. The organisation is not helping itself with a lack of transparency about this regrettable incident. A video clip emerged of Mashaba having to be calmed down following the Senegal game, with his ire apparently directed at a number of people, including Jordaan. Mashaba should probably have controlled his temper, but this does smack of an association looking for a reason to sack their head coach. Could it be that the result against Senegal didn t give them that reason, so they found another one? Of no doubt is that the whole affair is a mess, presided over by an association that for all its claims of Vision 2022 has displayed no direction for a number of years. Perhaps instead of sacking a coach, the likes of Mumble and Jordaan should start by sacking themselves. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
