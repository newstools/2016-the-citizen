The SA Post Office is encouraging motorists to have their car licence discs checked before embarking on holiday trips to avoid traffic fines over the festive season, reports City Buzz. This after the organisation recorded more than 3.7 million motor vehicle licence renewals in Gauteng branches during the 2015/16 financial year. The SA Post Office has 75 branches in Gauteng, including branches in Randburg and parts of Johannesburg. Geert Bataille, head of the SA Post Office s retail division, reminded motorists of the licensing procedure. Motorists must remember to take proof of residence and an identity document along when renewing car licences. This is a legal requirement. &#8220;Should motorists not have received a renewal notice, the renewal form [ALV] may be downloaded from www.enatis.com, said Bataille. He added that, by law, vehicle licence renewals must be done in the province where the vehicle is registered and can thus cannot be done while on holiday in another province. Motorists who have received a traffic fine issued in terms of the Aarto Act [Administrative Adjudication of Road Traffic Offences] may pay the traffic fine at any post office countrywide, Bataille concluded.
