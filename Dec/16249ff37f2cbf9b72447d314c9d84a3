A Manaba woman in KwaZulu-Natal was robbed and raped in her home. Police spokesperson Captain Gerald Mfeka said: The 68-year-old woman said she was taken by surprise because she had the windows closed and doors locked on Tuesday. She then heard her dogs barking, and when she went to check she came across a man inside the house. He ordered her to the bedroom, tied her up and then raped her, he said. After the ordeal, the intruder locked the woman inside the bathroom and fled, taking a cellphone, cash and food, South Coast Herald reported. No arrests have been made. Investigations are ongoing. &#8211; Caxton News Service
