The Directorate For Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) Eastern Cape provincial head, Major-General, Nyameko Nogwanya, has urged the Eastern Cape community to be careful towards the close of this festive season. During January 2017, there will be many adverts talking to scams, scholarships, lucrative deals, bursaries. People must be very vigilant, easy come easy go, said Nogwanya. Furthermore, the recklessness of traditional surgeons that lead to many unwarranted deaths at initiation schools needs to be looked at a close range whether there is no third element linking to trafficking of body parts. Trafficking in persons comes in different lucrative ways, people must be careful, added Nogwanya. Nogwanya explained that they had witnessed numerous cases where people were the victims of well-orchestrated crimes, such as, deposit scams, traditional healer scams, black dollar scams and human trafficking. All these cases seem to be perpetuated by people with more relation outside South Africa and some extent, foreign nationals seem to be leading towards victimising our African women, South African in particular, said Nogwanya. People are hereby warned to be very careful of getting into unscrutinised relationships because they become victims of a well-orchestrated crime, under the pretext of love, as a gateway to their monies, said Nogwanya. Against all odds the Hawks shall always strive to ensure that people of the Eastern Cape are and feel safe, we wish you a happy festive season. Don t be a victim of crime, added Nogwanya.
