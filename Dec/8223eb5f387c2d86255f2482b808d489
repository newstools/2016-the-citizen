It s all but two years since Opel s MOKKA reached our shores and, with more than 6 00 000 units sold globally since introduction, the German carmaker has introduced a pre-Christmas makeover model that gains a different nameplate, with it now called the MOKKA X. A quick stop at one of Cape Town&#8217;s mountain passes to savour the moment. Pictures: Ntsako Mthethwa and supplied The new Opel MOKKA X is the first to carry the X name badge that Opel says is the new global identifier for future Opel SUV and crossover cars. To find out if the pre-Christmas present is really intended at pleasing plucky daughters who are looking for a vehicle that is safe, family oriented and powerful, off we headed to Cape Town for its local launch. Within a minute with the refreshed MOKKA X, the key highlight and most obvious change is the move to new headlight clusters that combine daytime running lamps and LED technology. . Like the model it replaces, the MOKKA X comes in a four-model line-up of Enjoy and Cosmo trim choices, either in manual or automatic transmission. The first moment inside the car was all we needed to really get to know what Opel has in store for its customers. All four models boast enough space for five the new MOKKA X is aimed at first-time car buyers, students or singles who need a suitable runaround. Interior trim is revised too. The Enjoy model is dressed in Milano Jet Black upholstery, and the Cosmo in Jasmin Jet Black. Dashboard architecture from the new Astra has also been seamlessly integrated, for a more modern look and feel, along with improved ergonomics. . The Cosmo now boasts an infotainment system with R4.0 IntelliLink and a driver display this connectivity package is compatible with a wide range of media platforms via a USB input and is offered as an option on the Enjoy. Optional on the Cosmo is Navi 900 IntelliLink, which includes a full-colour display. In addition to the optional Navi 900 IntelliLink system, Cosmo owners can upgrade to a premium LED lighting package that adds rear LED clusters and auto-levelling headlights with full Adaptive Forward Lighting technology and integrated cornering lights for maximum safety &#8211; without negatively impacting other road users. The Nissan Juke rival, either in manual or automatic transmission, delivers much in efficiency and sensibility. The sweet noise of the 1.4-litre incites sensations to the drive. The MOKKA X showed the need to get up and hit the road and, during the launch drive through the Allesverloren via Bainskloof and Tulbagh, the car delivered impressive handling dynamics. . Opel has done a very good job as the MOKKA X has proven to be a go-anywhere SUV, thanks to the high seating position and extra space offered by the foldable rear seats. However, it struggled a bit under hard acceleration. Both models showed a spot of good fuel efficiency, which, according to our drive, returned satisfactory numbers, like most cars in its segment. Opel claims 5.9 litres/100km of average fuel economy on the new Enjoy manual and 6.2 litres/100km for the 1.4T Enjoy automatic. The MOKKA X 1.4T Cosmo manual sips 6.0 litres per 100 km, with the MOKKA X 1.4T Cosmo automatic returning a combined cycle average figure of 6.5 litres per 100 km. A sprint from 0-100km/h is achievable in 9.8 seconds for the 6-speed manual models before hitting a limiter at 196km/h. For the two models equipped with the 6-speed automatic transmission, the 0-100 km/h sprint is achieved in 10.7 seconds and they carry a top speed of 191 km/h. The ride is exceptional, even over nasty, aggressive surfaces. It remains settled, the dampers soaking up all the bumps with impressive comfort. The steering wheel felt well weighted and not overly assisted, as does some of its rivals. Conclusion The automatic MOKKA X Cosmo is our top choice we find it more fun to drive and it provides more drivability on the roads. It is a family car aimed at buyers who are always on the move.
