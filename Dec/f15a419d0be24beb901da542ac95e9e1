Distance runner Irvette van Zyl earned family bragging rights on Thursday, while middle-distance specialist Amos Nyongo secured a clean sweep to close out the BestMed Eden Street Mile Series. Van Zyl wrapped up the women&#8217;s race in 4:46.85 at the third and final leg of the campaign in Hartenbos. She also triumphed in a one-on-one contest against husband LJ van Zyl, the SA men&#8217;s 400m hurdles record holder, in a friendly year-end spousal clash. While his official time was unavailable, LJ van Zyl crossed the line around 100 metres off the pace, according to reports, after lining up in the elite women&#8217;s race in a sideline challenge. Kesa Molotsane, who won the opening leg of the series in Oudtshoorn last week and finished second in George on Tuesday, again took second place in the women&#8217;s 1.6km event in 4:51.74. In the elite men&#8217;s race, Nyongo charged to another victory in 4:02.16. Nyongo, who had won in Oudtshoorn (3:55.60) and George (4:07.57), held off a challenge from Jeromy Andreas who grabbed second spot in 4:03.40.
