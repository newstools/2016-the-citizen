Day three at St George&#8217;s Park was supposed to be Stephen Cook&#8217;s. A year or so ago, he was told by friends and family he should quit the game. Now he&#8217;s got three Test centuries in 12 innings. Well, maybe it was his day but heck, Hashim Amla became the 10 000th victim of the LBW! And the worst? The bowler to do that is &#8230; Nuwan Pradeep?? Surely that&#8217;s THE plot? As a bowler, Vernon Philander is nonchalant at the best of times. Wow! Philander bang on the money from the word go, gets the important wicket of De Silva 1st ball for 43. Cracking delivery, shaped away &mdash; Ken Borland (@KenBorland) December 28, 2016 Brilliant start by @VDP_24! Gets the day started with a double strike. SL are 185/9 (58 ovs) #ProteaFire #ProteaFire #SAvSL #SunfoilTest pic.twitter.com/6m2Ucc7Fhk &mdash; Cricket South Africa (@OfficialCSA) December 28, 2016 The Proteas fielders weren&#8217;t all that smooth though. 3 opportunities for SA to get a run out! Looks like these two are saving their legs for when they have to bowl! @SPORTATSABC &mdash; Sunfoil Cricket (@SunfoilCricket) December 28, 2016 Philander&#8217;s five-wicket haul gained well-deserved praise. https://twitter.com/robbie13flair/status/814027582228336640 Dean Elgar reached a milestone as he initially scratched and poked during his innings. Congratulations @deanelgar who has surpassed 1 500 Test runs. #ProteaFire #SAvSL pic.twitter.com/YgPIaMiRwA &mdash; Cricket South Africa (@OfficialCSA) December 28, 2016 Dean Elgar has finally passed 1500 Test runs. I usually score that in a series vs India. &mdash; Quinton not de Kock (@notdekock) December 28, 2016 As Cook and Elgar ambled along, Robbie P decided to discuss cricketing politics. I think it would be great if the @ICC could have team of the year at their awards in the same way the IRB does weighted across all formats &mdash; Robin John Peterson (@robbie13flair) December 28, 2016 https://twitter.com/robbie13flair/status/814045424818520065 Earlier, PE had been struck by lighting (weird!) and now it was delivering some other strange weather. Jakkals trou met wolf se vrou right now at St. George&#39;s Park #SAvSL &mdash; Gerald Imray (@GeraldImrayAP) December 28, 2016 On a serious note, Cook and Elgar were relentless. 100+ 1st wkt partnership in both inns by same pair for SA: B Mitchell &amp; B Catterall 119 &amp; 171 v Eng Birm 1929 S Cook &amp; D Elgar v SL PE 2016 &mdash; Andrew Samson (@AWSStats) December 28, 2016 In an indication of things to come, Hashim Amla was already a victim of statistical quirks. Amla needs to score at least 62, before getting out, in this innings to take his average past 50. #SAvSL &mdash; Bharath Seervi (@SeerviBharath) December 28, 2016 Stephen Cook&#8217;s hundred was indeed a highlight. https://twitter.com/Geoff_Cricket/status/814109013310930944 Can&#39;t argue with three centuries in seven Test matches, says Kepler of Stephen Cook. No, you can&#39;t. &mdash; Rob Houwing (@RobHouwing) December 28, 2016 The horror! Hashim Amla was the #10000th victim! But the worst surely was the bowler the honour belongs to&#8230;. Hashim Amla is the 10,000th lbw dismissal in Test #cricket. But more worryingly, he is out for 48&#8230; The slump continues. #SAvSL &mdash; Firdose Moonda (@FirdoseM) December 28, 2016 So the 10,000th lbw in Tests finally goes, on the brink of tea, to &#8230; Pradeep! &mdash; Rob Houwing (@RobHouwing) December 28, 2016 Stephen Cook isn&#8217;t only breaking stereotypes but records also. Stephen Cook is currently the 3rd highest run-scorer after first seven tests. Needs 28 runs to get to number 1 pic.twitter.com/85JuDagcTU &mdash; Derek Alberts (@derekalberts1) December 28, 2016 Little Temba Bavuma succumb to spin &#8230; again. And he&#8217;s supposed to be quite good at handling it. Disappointing Test for Bavuma, 3 in 1st innings &amp; 8 in 2nd, caught at short-leg off De Silva. Pitched leg &amp; turned down, thin edge on to pad &mdash; Ken Borland (@KenBorland) December 28, 2016 And as commentators and pundits were debating the mystery of when the Proteas should declare, Morne Morkel was engaged in his own one. Scooby Doo Bee Doo! Not so sure about that shark video going around at #strandfontein.. same video on YouTube taken in 2011 in Fish Hoek.. #bringinScoobydoo &mdash; Morne Morkel (@mornemorkel65) December 28, 2016 For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
