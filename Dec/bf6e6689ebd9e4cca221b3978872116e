Eight people, who were arrested for selling fake CDs and DVDs worth thousands of rand, will appear in the Molopo Magistrate s Court in Mmabatho on Thursday, the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) in North West said. The Hawks said the suspects were arrested on Wednesday in Mahikeng during an operation to tackle music and movie piracy. Fake CD s and DVD S worth about R162,100 were seized. The impact of piracy is mostly felt by the creative industry such as musicians and film makers hence we roped in musicians and the Film and Publications Board to be part of the operation, said Hawks provincial head, Major General Linda Mbana. On a greater scale, piracy affects the economy and costs South Africa lots of money in tax revenue. The suspects will be charged for breaching the Films and Publications Act
