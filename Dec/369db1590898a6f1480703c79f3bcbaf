Blac Chyna has caused another rift in the Kardashian clan this time for allegedly stealing her and Rob Kardashian s newborn, Dream, after clearing out the house she shares with the older Kardashian brother. In true Kardashian fashion, the latest drama unfolded on the popular picture sharing app SnapChat. Yesterday, Kardashian posted a video crying into the camera saying Chyna had vacated their home after she called it quits with the new father. Chyna quickly responded on her new Instagram account stating: He s on SnapChat acting hurt but he s yet to come see Dream! He knows where we are! Honestly it s only so much a person can take. Everyone has tried to help Rob. I ve gone beyond to help and so has his family. &#8220;I no longer have time to feed into Robert s shenanigans. I have two children and myself to fend for. What hurts the most is watching him do this to me knowing my last situation and promising to never put me through it. But as heartfelt as Rob Kardashian s latest SnapChat story may be percieved the drama came just in time to promote the Rob &amp; Chyna Baby Special, which aired in America last night. In the build-up to last night s TV special Chyna opened up about her relationship with Kardashian s mom. On the show, Chyna gets a 4D sonogram of baby Dream and decides to FaceTime Kris to show her the photo, saying: Kris is like a second mother to me.
