A former Northern Cape police reservist has been found guilty by the Springbok Magistrates Court of impersonating a public prosecutor. Abraham Jacobus Visagie impersonated a Senior Public Prosecutor to solicit a bribe in Springbok Magistrates Court. He approached a 54-year-old woman facing a possible charge of culpable homicide and promised to protect her against prosecution. Visagie, 39, demanded R6 000 for himself and an additional R15 000 for his associates who would assist on the case. The investigation ensued soon after the matter was reported to the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks). Hawks spokesperson Captain Philani Nkwalase said Visagie made his first court appearance on June 13 on charges of fraud and corruption and was granted R2 000 bail. On Monday, Visagie pleaded guilty and consequently was sentenced to three years&#8217; imprisonment. His sentence was wholly suspended for three years on condition that he is not found guilty of similar offences during the specified period.
