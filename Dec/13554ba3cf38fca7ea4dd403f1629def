You had to be impressed with the calmly reasoned manner in which Magistrate Jongilizwe Dumehleli approached the highly charged emotions inherent in the bail hearing brought in the Middleburg Magistrate s Court by Theo Martins Jackson and Willem Oosthuizen in what has been dubbed the Coffin Case &#8230; and the firm, understated control the magistrate commanded over the court. Though the courts have still to rule on the guilt or innocence of the pair and as the constitution dictates, there must be a presumption of innocence until the courts decide definitively to the contrary there can be no arguing the bubbling rage within the community at the allegations levelled at the pair. Magistrate Dumehleli dismissed the granting of bail, citing among other considerations that this particular legal right could be waived if there was a chance that a counter-ruling might endanger the equanimity of balance within society and possibly lead to social disorder. The magistrate also clearly pointed out the likelihood of bloodshed and that it would not be in the interests of justice for the pair to be granted bail. The allegations levelled against the pair are of a horrendous nature: the victim, Victor Rethabile Mlotshwa, had been accused of trespassing, severely beaten, forced against his will into a coffin and threatened with being set alight. This, we would suggest from a lay point of view, became less of the likelihood the magistrate referred to, than a near certainty. But it was with solemn gravitas that the magistrate made perhaps the most salient point of the hearing. Racism is not a conduct that can only be attached to whites, he said. Racism is a virus that the whole world is trapped under. As fellow thinking human beings, we should all subscribe to this sage dictum.
