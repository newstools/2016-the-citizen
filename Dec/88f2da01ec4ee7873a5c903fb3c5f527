The former national u-19 captain on Tuesday was confirmed as skipper of the England Lions &#8211; the feeder team to the national side &#8211; for their tour to Sri Lanka. &#8220;Keaton has impressed everyone with his batting and his leadership,&#8221; said James Whittaker, a national selector, in a statement.
