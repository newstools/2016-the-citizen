A livid Zahara has taken to Instagram to question True Love&#8217;s intentions after the cover story she did with them was published nationally a day ago. The cover reads: &#8220;Zahara: marriage drugs and selling records.&#8221; Speaking to Tshisa Live, Zahara said she was shocked to see the cover alluding to drugs when she didn&#8217;t speak on it. Before the interview, we had agreed on what we would talk about. In the interview, we talked about hair body and marriage. I was excited because this was the first time I revealed certain things about my love life, but drugs and alcohol was never discussed she said. I have been trying to call their offices, but no one is answering! Fed up [with] my name always being used to sell magazines and newspapers she said. ALSO READ: Kelly Khumalo returns to Rhythm City! True Love is yet to respond to the outcry, which has gained momentum on Twitter, with celebrites like AKA and Bonang tweeting that the magazine was &#8220;trash&#8221; and did not care about women&#8217;s issues. I honestly hope this is a sick joke from @truelovemagazine, how dare they put this type of headline on their cover! Why associate me with drugs?? This is an utterly tasteless and misleading caption! Perhaps it&#8217;s an effort to boost sales!! Ndidikiwe kengoku, if they dont recall this cover today, I will be left with no choice but to take legal action against them! I have been trying to call their offices but no one is answering! Fed up of my name always being used to sell magazines and newspapers!
