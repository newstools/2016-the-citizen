Some think it would be a victory for the landless if EFF leader Julius Malema were to be president, while others think the country would collapse like Zimbabwe did. These are some of the perspectives that emerged from a Twitter trending topic that took off last night on the social media site. His fans felt he would solve the thorny issue of racism and corruption, and others thought the hashtag was just wishful thinking, and the EFF leader would never run the country. There was a humorous side to the discussion as well, as some said Limpopo, Malema&#8217;s home province, would be the &#8220;capital city&#8221; yes, city of South Africa under his leadership. &#8220;No more sleeping in parliament,&#8221; some said, while others thought President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s homestead, Nkandla, would be turned into a museum &#8220;of corruption&#8221;. Rorisang said: &#8220;#IfMalemaWasPresident South Africa will be shwashwi, always gossiping and exposing files of other countries.&#8221; Konketso @konketso1: &#8220;#IfMalemaWasPresident Nkandla will be turned in to a museum of corruption.&#8221; Reneilwe&#8217;s Birthday @Legendary_Thato said: &#8220;#IfMalemaWasPresident TUT will make make strike training a module for 1st year students.&#8221; https://twitter.com/maphale25/status/806403592395616256 #IfMalemaWasPresident,we would finally know what was in this briefcase&#8230; pic.twitter.com/BX5XCH8bgV &mdash; Mercedes P.
