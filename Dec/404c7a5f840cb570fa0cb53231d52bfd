The Blitzboks&#8217; captaincy baton was passed with the greatest of ease as they thrashed Uganda 46-0 in their first pool game of the Dubai Sevens tournament. Kyle Brown, who relinquished his leadership role at the end of this year&#8217;s Olympics, clearly enjoyed his newfound freedom as senior player by being instrumental in the first half. His silky break from the first kick-off laid the groundwork for Werner Kok, returning after a long injury layoff, to round off a sweeping move, before executing a perfect cross-kick for Phillip Snyman, the man who has taken over his captaincy duties. Snyman&#8217;s power and neat side-stepping ability also led to a second visit over the whitewash as Uganda has no answer to a sustained assault. The wheels came off badly after the interval for the East Africans as the Blitzboks scored an additional five tries. Seabelo Senatla, crowned World Rugby&#8217;s Sevens Player of the Year for 2016 about a fortnight ago, crowned his accolade with a brace, while Kwagga Smith was a menace at the breakdowns after coming on as a substitute. South Africa&#8217;s next game is against Scotland at 11:06. Point-scorers: Blitzboks (19) &#8211; Tries: Phillip Snyman (2), Seabelo Senatla (2), Werner Kok, Rosco Speckman, Ruhan Nel, Kwagga Smith.
