Comedian Trevor Noah&#8217;s girlfriend, Jordyn Taylor, has finally opened up about her relationship with Noah and what it&#8217;s like to live with him. Taking to Instagram recently to talk about his his book, Born A Crime, Taylor said she had been procrastinating reading the final chapter of her favourite book. &#8220;I always procrastinate on the final chapter of my very favorite books. I do this mainly because I don&#8217;t want the magic to end.&#8221; She said she had been delaying finishing the book because she knew the pain the last chapter explored, further sharing how proud she was of her &#8220;dimply-faced&#8221; boyfriend. &#8220;I&#8217;m so proud of the dimply-faced crime who shared with us the deepest and sometimes darkest parts of his life, who taught us about nuance and the complexity of good and evil, and who introduced us to one of the strongest women we may ever know. It&#8217;s time to read these last few pages.&#8221; While for the rest of us, Noah&#8217;s magic ends on the stage, and now his book, for Taylor, it carries on in their home. &#8220;I&#8217;m delighted with the knowledge that the magic does carry on well past the back cover and I am beyond blessed to come home to that magic day after day. thank you @trevornoah.&#8221; &#8230;&#8230;I always severly procrastinate on the final chapter of my very favorite books.

He, however, recently spoke about it in an interview with Anele Mdoda on Real Talk. Noah said he has never allowed his relationships to affect everything else. He said he wanted to be happy at all times, single or not, and did not want to give someone else the power to control how he felt. As a result, he said there was no difference between the Noah who was in love and the one who wasn t. I realise that if I love myself and I have friends that love me and family that loves me, I exist in a constant state of love, though he admits that he is indeed very much in love. He further said he was very happy and continued to work on being happy. That s the thing I learned: happiness is a choice; happiness is hard work. Read more: What Trevor Noah is like when he s in love
