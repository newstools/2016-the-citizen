On Friday, the South African Rugby Union&#8217;s (Saru) general council meet in Cape Town to dissect various issues. In years gone by, these meetings have gone by fairly unnoticed but 2016&#8217;s won&#8217;t. The Springboks have just come off their worst season &#8211; 4 wins in 12 matches &#8211; since the start of the professional era in 1996 and local rugby is facing severe challenges. Saru have confirmed the future of Allister Coetzee, the embattled Springbok coach, will not be discussed as his performance review will be conducted by the governing body&#8217;s high performance committee on Tuesday. Instead, here are the important items on the agenda for Friday: Private ownership Unlike soccer, rugby is still caught in the amateur era. According to Saru&#8217;s constitution, a provincial union must still be the majority shareholder in its own operation. A private party&#8217;s share is thus limited to 49%. That is a problem, especially since local teams have to compete in a market where overseas competitors are privately-owned and the exchange rate is unfavourable. South African rugby is bleeding leading players at an alarming rate and local rugby desperately needs extra funding to at least try to stop the exodus. Saru though will need to change its constitution in this regard and its understood parties have agreed to increase private ownership to 74%. It is also hoped this will encourage unions to run their financial affairs better and avoid the liquidations of Eastern and Western Province. Provincial borders The South African Sport Confederation and Olympic Committee (Sascoc) has given Saru until 16 December to change its decision-making model in line with municipal borders. Currently, all 14 provincial unions have one vote &#8211; usually its president. Sascoc&#8217;s new requirements now mean 14 unions need to be fitted into South Africa&#8217;s 9 provinces. This is a headache. For example, the Western (Western Province and Boland) and Eastern Cape (Eastern Province and Border) have two unions in their geopolitical region. It&#8217;s even stickier in Gauteng, under which the Lions, Valke and Blue Bulls fall. Suddenly, these unions now have to share a vote? Limpopo doesn&#8217;t have a professional team but might have a vote? The model in that form is flawed and compromises are likely to be made. Bye-bye Currie Cup? The Currie Cup is becoming increasingly marginalised as the Super Rugby tournament continues to dominate the rugby calendar. Saru apparently favours reverting back to a &#8220;strength versus strength&#8221; competition between the six top sides but what happens to the other unions? The format of the competition has been changed so much in the last decade, it&#8217;s becoming a bit of a joke. The Currie Cup has become badly diluted and rumours are it might fall away by 2018. Saru&#8217;s budget The governing body will reportedly make a loss of R19 million this year and a staggering R150 million if they can&#8217;t find a title sponsor for the Springboks quickly. The majority of the provincial unions are reliant on Saru funding to keep themselves afloat. South African rugby is known for its petty self-interest, so will union bosses vote to approve the budget if their slice is smaller? &nbsp;
