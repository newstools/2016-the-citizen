When Frank Isenberg, the BMW M2 chief engineer, said the German marque has no plans to build an M2 convertible because convertibles are not for racetracks, drop-top lovers weren&#8217;t so happy at all. But thanks to D hler, the Swiss tuning firm, the smile has been put back on their faces. . D hler has built a BMW M2 convertible, although the firm didn t go into much detail as to how the conversion works, but the creation looks good enough to come straight from the Bavarian automaker s factory. Looking at the body of the convertible, we notice that D hler isn t hacking up an authentic M2 body. Instead, it appears the firm is taking the existing 2 Series convertible and using the droptop as a base for further performance modifications. In terms of engine, D hler says the M2 is even more potent than what BMW offers from the stock coupe s 272 kW and 465 Nm. Available in two tunes; stage 1 pushes the turbocharged 3.0-liter in-line six to 300 kW (28 kW more) and 580 Nm giving it a spring from zero to 100km/h in just 4 seconds before maxing out at 290 km/h. . The Stage 2 upgrades bump the output to 313 kW (40 kW more) and 610 Nm, which also allows a top speed of 300 km/h. With the custom stainless steel exhaust, the M2 should sound really good. The system includes a pair of dark tips that come out of each corner of the rear. To keep this performance under control, D hler offers eight-piston brakes callipers with 15.75-inch (400-millimetre) rotors. The company s M2 convertible rides on an adjustable coil-over suspension with 16 levels of independent customisation for the rebound and compression. . The interior remains largely stock, except for D hler s MID display unit that replaces the centre HVAC vent on the driver s side. The little screen shows performance information such as the water and oil temperatures.
