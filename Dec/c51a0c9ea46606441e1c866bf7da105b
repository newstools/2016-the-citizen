According to Sheikh Ndauga, actual development will be conducted into phases of which the first one will involve normal cultivation on 200 hectares.

We will start by growing crops that will suit the normal rainy season like rice, maize, vegetables and other crops. The aim is to increase the affordability of food in this country and sell the rest outside the country .Our utmost goal is to cultivate a total of one million hectares in different parts of the country, he said.He also said that his organization has been involved in social issues and is determined to focus on agriculture as it seeks to play an increasingly important role in creating an economically independent Tanzania as envisioned by President John Magufuli.
