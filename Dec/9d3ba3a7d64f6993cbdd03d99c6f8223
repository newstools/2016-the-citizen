A former EFF MP, who was axed by the party after the August 3 municipal elections when he refused a &#8220;downgrade&#8221; to being a councillor, has reportedly taken the EFF to court. According to City Press, Emmanuel Mtileni wants to be reinstated to the National Council of Provinces seat that he had held since 2014. For that to happen, he would have to be reinstated by the court to the party, after which he could then be put back on the NCOP&#8217;s payroll. Mtileni is not the first EFF MP to be expelled from the party, and none of those who have suffered expulsion before him have won their own battles against the EFF. City Press reports that his court papers reveal that his financial situation has been badly impacted, with his children kicked out of private school and his VW Amarok repossessed. He claims that the party ignored or neglected disciplinary or labour processes and violating the Labour Relations Act. Mtileni&#8217;s replacement, Brenda Mathevula, was sworn in as an MP on December 1. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
