It doesn&#8217;t happen very often that French rugby clubs support each other but Johan Goosen has changed that to an extent. The 24-year-old Springbok utility back&#8217;s dodgy &#8220;retirement&#8221; at the weekend to skip out of his lucrative contract with Racing Metro clearly hasn&#8217;t led to any goodwill from other teams. Mourad Boudjellal, president of Toulon, has even gone as far as stating that any team that signs Goosen next are &#8220;bastards&#8221;. Also read: 24 and out! Shock for SA rugby as Johan Goosen retires &#8220;What he does is a breach of his contract. When a player has such an attitude, he must find closed doors everywhere,&#8221; Boudjellal told Rugby Rama. &#8220;Whichever club president signs Goosen next is a bastard. If a president signs, it puts all the other presidents of the Top 14 in danger. &#8220;When you sign a contract with a player, you already do not have many rights but many obligations. If a president recruits him, there will be even fewer rights.&#8221; Goosen has apparently tried to exploit a loophole in his so-called CDI contract. That theoretically means he had a &#8220;job for life&#8221; until he retires. By allegedly accepting a role as commercial director in a unnamed South African company, Goosen is forced to &#8220;retire&#8221; from full-time rugby. And that means he could get out of his R7.27 million per year contract a bit easier.

If he signs, he can&#8217;t play for any French club for at least 18 months. There are also rumours that Goosen, who is &#8220;homesick&#8221;, wants to retire in order to lower his market value for a South African side to be able to afford him.
