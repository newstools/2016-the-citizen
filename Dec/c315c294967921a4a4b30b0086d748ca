Minister of Sports and Recreation Fikile Mbalula has also taken to social media to share his best moments of 2016. Among other things, enforcing transformation in the Springbok rugby team was included among Mbalula&#8217;s best moments of the year, in addition to the clean audit his ministry got. The ministry also supplied sport facilities to several rural schools. Wayde van Niekerk and Caster Semenya, who won gold medals at the Rio Olympics in August, also made the minister&#8217;s year memorable. Even Bonang &#8220;Queen B&#8221; Matheba got a mention from the sports minister. At first we thought he was talking about his obsession with pop star Beyonce when he only referred to her as &#8220;Queen B&#8221;, but the picture he shared on his Twitter account made it clear he was being proudly South African. #bestof2016 Transformation enforced AG Clean Audits Facilities to Schools (Rural Sport launch) Rio 2016 Queen B and so on an so forth pic.twitter.com/Oy7Y6x83lr &mdash; RSA Min of Sport (@MbalulaFikile) December 27, 2016 We still haven&#8217;t figured out why she made it on to his list.
