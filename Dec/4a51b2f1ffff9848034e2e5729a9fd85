Seven people were each convicted to 15 years imprisonment in the Benoni Magistrates&#8217; Court last Thursday, reports the Benoni City Times. According to the Hawks Captain Ndivhuwo Mulamu, the serious organised crime members acted on a tip-off and arrested the men in Crystal Park in October 2014, after they were found packaging heroine worth an estimated R214 000. Mulamu said the drugs were destined for distribution in Crystal Park. Major-General Prince Mokotedi, the Gauteng head of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, welcomed the sentencing of Valentine Chigbo Okoye (36), Patrick Chime Uche (38), Nonso Pascal Okodo (36) Chucks Ugo Thomas (37), Emeka Azodo (40), Chinaemelum Uba (24) and Chucku Imeka Ekwemozok (34). This is indeed a welcomed precedent set by our courts and this will help our efforts to combat drug trafficking a great deal, said Mokotedi. We are proud of our team s efforts in ensuring a successful prosecution in this matter. Such convictions will motivate our members to work even harder. From now on, drug dealers will feel the full might of the law; we are more determined to fight this scourge. Caxton News Service More news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
