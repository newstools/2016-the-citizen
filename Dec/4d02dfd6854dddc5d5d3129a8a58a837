Refiloe &#8220;Cassper Nyovest&#8221; Phoolo is coming out to show off the brand-new Bentley he bought just after he nearly filled Orlando Stadium in October. The Mama I Made It hit maker had stopped posting pictures of his house, cars, leaving fans worried. &#8220;Nyovest I think you should continue posting your achievements bruh we get inspired out here @CassperNyovest. God Bless you more grootman,&#8221; tweeted one fan. Cassper said he did not like the envy his posts bred, without specifying where the envy was coming from. &#8220;Eish my dawg.. I really don&#8217;t like the envy it breeds but I&#8217;ll try post a lil.. at the end of the day I&#8217;m all about inspiring my people,&#8221; he said. The car, which has now been customised, is slowly making its way to social media and we&#8217;re not complaining. His friend Somizi was the first to post about it, though he did not tell fans whose car it was. &#8220;My friend is Gonna kill me. But as u know me I love celebrating success. Congrats. God bless u more. Ur the hardest under30 year old I know. Lunch is on me this weekend. I&#8217;m cooking. U see it&#8217;s not that bad. I didn&#8217;t say who,&#8221; he wrote on Instagram the day it was bought. And now, his other friend Oskido has posted a video of the car. He further told his fans that Cassper was also building a mansion. &#8220;@casspernyovest took some time to show his Bentley. The first SA rapper to own a Bentley. Now waiting for him to finish building that mansion. #ibelieve,&#8221; he wrote. Check out the video below:
