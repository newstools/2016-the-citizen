Ban Ki-moon left the door open to possibly running for president of South Korea in his final press conference as United Nations secretary general, noting that the country is &#8220;in turmoil&#8221;. Ban, a South Korean citizen who leaves his current post at the end of the year, was at first evasive when asked Friday about his political future. &#8220;I am still the Secretary-General. I still have 15 days to go,&#8221; Ban said. But after leaving the UN the 72-year-old plans to take a rest, then go to South Korea and &#8220;try to meet as many people as possible, which may include political leaders and leaders of the community, societies and my friends.&#8221; &#8220;I will really consider seriously how best and what I should and I could do for my country,&#8221; he told reporters, noting South Korea is &#8220;in turmoil&#8221;. Ban&#8217;s statements follow days of protests demanding the swift and permanent removal of impeached South Korean President Park Geun-Hye. Lawmakers on December 9 voted to impeach Park over a corruption scandal, opening a new period of national uncertainty. Ban said that he understood &#8220;the aspiration of people for a new type of inclusive leadership,&#8221; and suggested that &#8220;social integration, reconciliation and much more mature democratic institutions&#8221; could help. Ban, a former South Korean foreign minister who was widely believed to be angling to run for the presidency, was expected to run in elections next year as the leader of Park&#8217;s party. The scandal however may have derailed his plans. &#8220;I can understand and share the anxiety of people&#8221; about the country&#8217;s future, he said Friday. &#8220;I know that they don&#8217;t want to lose the hard-earned democracy and the economic development,&#8221; which transformed South Korea &#8220;from a recipient country to a global donor. That is one pride that the Korean people have.&#8221; Nevertheless, Ban said, &#8220;I&#8217;m confident that the Korean people, with their resilience and very mature democratic institutions &#8230; will be able to overcome these difficulties soon.&#8221; ch-bur/kb 1994-2016 Agence France-Presse
