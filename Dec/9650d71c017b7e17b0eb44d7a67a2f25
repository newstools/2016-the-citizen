US President-elect Donald Trump got plenty of attention &#8212; but not the kind he was looking for &#8212; after a tweet Saturday calling out China for its seizure of an unmanned US naval probe. &#8220;China steals United States Navy research drone in international waters &#8212; rips it out of water and takes it to China in unpresidented (sic) act,&#8221; the real estate magnate wrote on his favorite platform. &#8220;Unpresidented&#8221; quickly became a top trending topic on Twitter in the United States, as online wags savaged the incoming president for the unfortunate misspelling. &#8220;TrumpSpellCheck &#8212; Unpresidentedly effective,&#8221; tweeted &#8220;Harry Potter&#8221; author JK Rowling. &#8220;Dear world, most Americans really wish we could be #unpresidented,&#8221; another Twitter user wrote. Trump deleted the tweet after about an hour, replacing it with one correctly using the word &#8220;unprecedented.&#8221; While many mocked the deeply divisive political novice, famous for his verbal tics and gaffes, supporters jumped to his defense and said critics were piling on about a typo while ignoring the bigger problem. Trump was referring to China&#8217;s seizure on Thursday of an unmanned US naval probe in international waters of the South China Sea, a serious provocation as tensions rise between the two superpowers. Trump has repeatedly infuriated Beijing in recent weeks, questioning longstanding US policy on Taiwan, calling Beijing a currency manipulator and threatening Chinese imports with punitive tariffs. The Pentagon on Friday called on Beijing to &#8220;immediately&#8221; return the probe that it had &#8220;unlawfully seized.&#8221; acb/kb 1994-2016 Agence France-Presse
