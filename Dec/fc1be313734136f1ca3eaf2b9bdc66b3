With the first long weekend of the festive season ahead, eThekwini municipality reports that since the beginning of the week, an estimated 122 313 people have visited the various city beaches, reports the Berea Mail. About 2 150 armbands have been issued, lifesavers have carried out 49 rescues and 196 people have received first aid treatment for blue bottle stings and minor cuts. Warm weather is forecast for the rest of the long weekend and the city anticipates beaches will be packed to capacity with both locals and visitors alike. In an effort to minimise traffic congestion along the beachfront, road closures will be implemented and only motorists with beach permits will be allowed access to areas beyond the boom gates. Residents who reside within the beach precinct can collect permits at the metro police office at Boscombe Place. Proof of residence is required when collecting permits. As far as beach and city maintenance is concerned, municipal staff will work daily to ensure the beaches and surrounding areas remain litter free. About 124 518.91 tons of litter have already been collected this week. The Durban Solid Waste clean-up team of about 130 people, works three shifts from 6am to 2.30pm, 3pm to 11pm and 10pm to 5.30am. No drownings have been reported. Caxton News Service
