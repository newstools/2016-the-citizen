South African former world number two wheelchair junior tennis player Thando Hlatshwayo has died at the age of 20. Hlatshwayo, who hails from Paulpietersburg in Kwazulu-Natal, lost her battle against meningitis early on Tuesday morning after a very short illness, her family said. She took up wheelchair tennis in 2009, and played her first tournament in April 2010, in East London. After only two years in the sport, Hlatshwayo had risen through the ranks to represent South Africa in the ITF Junior Camp Mechelen in Belgium. The ever smiling Hlatswayo also represented South Africa in Russia, Great Britain, Sri Lanka, and Mauritius. She was ranked 49th in the world, with her best singles ranking No 36. Hlatshwayo s most notable career moment was reaching the finals of the Airports Company South Africa Johannesburg Open, an ITF level three event at Ellis Park Tennis Stadium in December. Her last tournament was in Bloemfontein in October, where she won a doubles title and finished as a runner-up in the singles event to Mariska Venter. Wheelchair Tennis South Africa general manager Karen Losch said: Today we have lost a shining light from the heart, a true role model, great competitor and wonderful friend. We have so many special memories to cherish, but this leaves a gaping hole for everyone and words cannot express how saddened we are. May she rest in peace and remain in our memories. The tennis ace will be laid to rest at her home in Paulpietersburg, Bilanyoni Section, on Sunday at 10.30am. African News Agency For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
