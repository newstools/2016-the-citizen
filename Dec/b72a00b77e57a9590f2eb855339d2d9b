Member of the Mayoral Committee for Human Settlements Lesiba Mpya officially handed the keys to pensioners and Umkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) members, Benoni City Times reported. Their new houses in Combisa, in Etwatwa, Benoni, were available from Monday, December 19. The aim of Mpya s visit was to show people that the municipality had delivered on its promises. We wanted to ensure that these houses are not vacant by Christmas, Mpya said. The houses are complete, their owners were also allocated, and our role was to make sure they could move into them. He also told new property owners to ensure neatness of their yard and to avoid any erection of shacks on their property. I applied for the house in 1996, and after all of these years, I received one, said Nrateng Tsotetsi, 85, who is a pensioner. I thank our beloved government that my daughter and my two grandchildren will no longer live in shack, but in a proper house. &nbsp;
