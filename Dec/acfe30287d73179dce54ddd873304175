James Chichi Andrews and Regon Johnson briefly appeared before the Pretoria Magistrate s Court yesterday on charges of attempted murder. They were arrested in November for allegedly shooting 39-year-old Anver James outside the Eersterust Police Station. State prosecutor Michael Shivuri said a base statement was incomplete, resulting in inadequate information to proceed. The base statement is not elaborated and other matters are not clear. We also tried to contact the investigating officer to be present but he is not in Pretoria today and only available next week, he said. Magistrate Lesetja Mphahlele postponed the bail application to Monday. James has fled his home, fearing for his life, as he believed the shooting was an attempted hit. He told The Citizen that Andrews had previously tried to kill him in September when he stabbed James in the upper body. Andrews then stabbed James s 25-year-old nephew to death on the same night. He was arrested for murder and released on bail. I was admitted to hospital for the stabbing and discharged six weeks later. Nine days after, I got a call from Andrews s friend, wanting to see me. I don t trust them so I immediately went to the police station. He said Andrews and the friend drove past him at the police station but quickly made a U-turn when they spotted him. As he approached their car, he said two men, Andrews and Johnson, stepped out of the car with firearms. They both started shooting at me. I ran into the gate of the police station towards the door. The cops all disappeared and ran for cover. They fired about 16 shots while walking towards me. Only one hit me, in the leg. It was terrifying. James feared his attackers could get bail as he felt their aim was to kill him for witnessing his nephew s murder. They still shot me in front of the police station. Where am I safe? If the court grants them bail, then I don t know.&#8221; For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
