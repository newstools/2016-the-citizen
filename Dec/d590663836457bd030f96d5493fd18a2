As a total of 4 941 police recruits yesterday passed out after having successfully completed the basic police development learning programme, acting national police commissioner Lieutenant-General Khomotso Phahlane said there were still too few white people applying to join the police. Police passing out parades took place simultaneously yesterday throughout the country, including the SAPS Academy Tshwane; SAPS Academy Bisho, Eastern Cape; SAPS Academy Philipi, Western Cape; and SAPS Academy Chatsworth, KwaZulu-Natal. Speaking after the graduation at the SAPS Academy in Tshwane, Phahlane said: The police is also home to white, coloured and Indian people. We are on record as having said that, particularly at the entry level, we are not getting the numbers we need as far as white people are concerned. We would want to serve all communities and we do not want to create an impression that this is an organisation which only accommodates a certain race. He added that part of their recruitment drive was to encourage people from those communities to join the police. Police Minister Nathi Nhleko said: We can t have a situation where the majority of South Africans happen to be black and largely African, but then have a situation where in institutions you don t have that kind of a reflection. I think we need to accept that particular point as a reality. And of course, having said so, let s not forget that the SAPS is an institution for all South Africans regardless of race, colour or creed. Everybody who aspires to become a member of the police service is welcome. Of the 4 941 recruits, 3 032 were males and 1 909 female. In July, 3 441 trainees graduated, bringing the total of newly trained police members to 8 000.
