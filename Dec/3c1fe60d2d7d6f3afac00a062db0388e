Commonwealth Games Australia (CGA) are open to hosting the 2022 Commonwealth Games should Durban lose its right to stage the event. South Africa were warned in October that they were in danger of losing the right to host the event if they did not meet a series of requirements they were supposed to have satisfied last year set by the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF). Host city Durban was given a November 30 deadline to submit important documents to the CGF to remain as the chosen city for the Games. It was confirmed that Durban did submit all the required documents, but now the CGF will take up to six weeks to fully evaluate the submission. Despite being awarded the Games in September 2015, Durban had failed to sign the Host City contract, establish and Organising Committee or make a single required payment to the CGF. Meanwhile, CGA chief executive Craig Phillips confirmed on Tuesday Australia would step in to host the games if needed. We would certainly consider it, Phillips said. From our perspective in terms of being part of the broader Commonwealth Games family, we would want to ensure the Games continue to be celebrated in and appropriate way. In the right sort of city, with the right venues and environment. It is important that the Games have a future, we are committed to that. Certainly, whatever part we could play in that, we are happy to play. If it means being a host again, then yes. If it means providing other support we will certainly look at doing that as well. The CGF now has the authority to choose a new host city if Durban has to withdraw. Durban was required to establish an Organising Committee within six months of being awarded the rights to host the event, but over a year later had still not created one. African News Agency
