Nigeria, still one of African soccer&#8217;s powerhouses, is not renowned for its rugby. But courier giants DHL are hoping to spread the gospel a bit after sending two Stormers stalwarts, the Springbok flanker Siya Kolisi and hooker Scarra Ntubeni, on a trip to the continent&#8217;s most populous country. DHL are the Capetonians&#8217; title sponsor in Super Rugby. To date, the two players haven&#8217;t been doing much rugby-related activities. Instead, they&#8217;ve spent time at the Lekki Conservation Centre &#8211; which boasts the largest canopy walkway in Afrika at an immense 401m long! &#8211; eaten traditional Nigerian food and even bought traditional clothing! Crunching tackles and line-out throws aren&#8217;t on the agenda just yet but Kolisi and Ntubeni have certainly made their presence felt. Great start to our trip with @DHLAfrica in Lagos. This is Lekki conversation centre . Longest canopy walkway in Africa! @skara2ntubeni pic.twitter.com/3n3Twt1Dp3 &mdash; siyamthanda kolisi (@kolisi1) December 13, 2016 Had a great time at Lekki conservation Centre @DHLAfrica with @GbemiOO and @kolisi1 #DHLstormersinlagos pic.twitter.com/gNStYJP7dw &mdash; siyabonga ntubeni (@skara2ntubeni) December 13, 2016 Stylish! @skara2ntubeni and @kolisi1 sporting sleek outfits from Mister Boya!
