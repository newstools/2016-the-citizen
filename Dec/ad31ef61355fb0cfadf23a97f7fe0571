That&#8217;s a lead of 432. 17.50: Little trouble for the Proteas as they go past a lead of 400. However, there&#8217;s probably not enough time for a declaration this evening. Only 5 overs remain and a changeover takes 3 overs. Expect an overnight one&#8230; SA 327/5. 17.37: Quinton de Kock, who survived a stumping chance, takes the Proteas past 300. They need 19 more runs to take their lead to 4o0. 17.18: OUT! Bit of a wobble here for the Proteas. Temba Bavuma, who misjudged Rangana Herath in the first innings, plays around an off-spinner from De Silva. There&#8217;s bat before pad and he trudges off. SA 277/5 now but the lead is 358. 17.11: GONE! JP Duminy and Faf du Plessis had been picking singles easily before the former pushes too hard at a De Silva ball. It finds the edge and Duminy&#8217;s caught at first slip. The Islanders have something to cheer about. SA 267/4. 16.53: WICKET! Cook&#8217;s fine innings is over. He tries to dab a wider delivery down to third man but the feet are nowhere and Dinesh Chandimal&#8217;s snaps up the edge. SA 245/3. 16.45: The runs are still coming easily for the Proteas. Might they be looking to declare overnight? The highest successful chase on this ground is merely 271. SA 239/2, the lead is 320. 16.04: Oh, and before we forget! Amla has the honour now of being the 10 000th batter in Test history to be dismissed LBW. 16.02: Hashim Amla moves across his stumps again but this time Nuwan Pradeep&#8217;s delivery is fuller and his plumb LBW. At least South Africa will feel better about his form now. He&#8217;s out for 48. SA 221/2. 15.58: 100 partnership between Cook and Amla. It&#8217;s come off only 112 balls. SA 221/1. 15.53: Stephen Cook goes to 99 with a sumptuous straight drive and then clips to leg to reach his 3rd Test hundred. Superb innings. SA 209/1. 15.48: Cook&#8217;s been really fluent in this innings, despite being dropped in the gully on 62. He&#8217;s on 95. Sri Lanka are looking increasingly listless. SA 201/1. 15.16: Hashim Amla has decided he&#8217;s going to play himself out of his slump by being aggressive. The bearded talisman is on 28 off 31. SA 156/1. 14.40: OUT! Dean Elgar tries to pull out of the blue but the length isn&#8217;t quite right and he&#8217;s caught at midwicket. Was that really needed? He&#8217;s out for 52. SA 116/1. 14.28: And a 50 for his partner Dean Elgar too. 14.25: Dodgy technique or not, Stephen Cook has been mightily effective in this game. He reaches a second fifty of the match with a neat push in front of square. The Proteas go past 100 too. SA 107/0. 14.08: And we&#8217;re back. Tea will now be taken at 16:00. Play can actually go on till 18:30. 13.45: So the sun is shining but it&#8217;s also raining at St George&#8217;s Park. It&#8217;s been a strange day. 13.36: You wouldn&#8217;t think the South Africans are scoring at almost four per over but the pressure is being lifted. SA 83/0. 13.06: Suranga Lakmal hasn&#8217;t found his range yet. Proteas stroll past 50. 12.53: The first over after the rain break is done. Dean Elgar had some tough moments against Angelo Mathews but that&#8217;s now to be expected on this surface. SA 40/0. 11.34: An early lunch has also been called. 11.33: It&#8217;s quite gloomy in PE now. The umpires decide to take the players off after a few shots of lighting are spotted. That&#8217;s unusual for the Bay. SA 39/0. 11.09: The Proteas&#8217; lead has gone past 100. The visitors&#8217; bowlers have been a tad unlucky. SA 21/0. 10.52: Stephen Cook is lucky with his first boundary &#8211; an edge wide of third slip. Sri Lankan bowlers causing some problems. SA 9/0. 10.34: OUT! The off-stump line finally works for Kyle Abbott. He gets Dushmantha Chameera to prod at one. The lead is 81, which, according to Vernon Philander, is useful. SL 205 all out. 10.29: The Islanders painstakingly get past 200. It&#8217;s all valuable runs. SL 202/9. 10.18: The lead&#8217;s been reduced to 93 after some sloppy fielding but the Proteas remain very much in control. SL 193/9. 10.05: WICKET! The first over isn&#8217;t even done and Philander has a five-for! After playing a good cut shot for four, Suranga Lakmal tamely scoops a clip to mid-on. SL 185/9. 10.00: GONE! What a start! Dhananjaya de Silva doesn&#8217;t even have time to get his stance right before he edges a beauty from Vernon Philander. Brilliant delivery. The stocky seamer now has 4/35. SL 181/8. 9.41: Missed Tuesday&#8217;s action? Check out our alternative #TweetReport 9.37: Vernon Philander said on Tuesday a lead of 80 would be valuable. He will be instrumental in swatting the Sri Lankan lower order aside. And who would be against it, because he&#8217;s back to his best. 9.35: It looks like an overcast day in the Bay. The Proteas seamers will be licking their lips as that would certainly assist them. South Africa lead by 105 runs on a tricky pitch and they&#8217;ll hope to keep that as close to three figures as possible. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
