Just two days before Christmas, the body of a 71-year-old man was found in his pool in Vanderbijlpark on Friday morning. ER24 said when paramedics arrived at about 10.30am, they found the elderly man submerged in the pool. Sadly, there was nothing that paramedics could do for him, and he was declared dead on the scene, said Werner Vermaak, ER24 spokesperson. It is believed that he has been submerged in the pool for more than a day. However, local authorities were called to the scene to investigate. Vermaak said the dead man was found on Friday morning by his gardener. The gardener alerted neighbours of the tragedy.
