Surely it must have been explained to our pampered ministerial elite that along with the favours rained down by sycophantic praise singers, the kudos of being titled Honourable Minister, the inflated salaries and a hugely expensive motor car buffered by a phalanx of blue light vehicles, there does come some reasoned responsibility. Following the dictum of Harry S Truman, the sponsor of any number of groundbreaking initiatives as US president, executive responsibility is encapsulated succinctly in a sign on his Oval Office desk proclaiming: The buck stops here . Someone, somewhere up the chain of command, has to accept accountability. Yet in a four-hour grilling at the hands of members of parliament, Communications Minister Faith Muthambi retreated into the shell adopted by the spoilt schoolchild: it wasn t me. I didn t do it. I didn t know. It stretches credulity to impossibly elastic lengths to take this seriously and harks back to Minister of Higher Education and Training Blade Nzimande s cop-out during the #FeesMustFall demonstration spilling over into the parliamentary precinct in Cape Town. Ministers, by their very designation as members of the Cabinet, must be prepared to front up for the verbal fusillades as well as the frenzied back-slapping. Not, we would suggest, claim sublime ignorance.
