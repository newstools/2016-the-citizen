Without saying so explicitly, Proteas coach Russell Domingo suggested South African cricket is sometimes too much of a &#8220;nice guy&#8221; when it comes to preparing pitches. Other world cricket teams are increasingly playing on wickets that heavily favour their players and undermine the opposition. The latest example has been India thumping England by cultivating spin-friendly tracks. Yet South Africa tends to still deliver fair, competitive wickets that don&#8217;t necessarily just benefit their own players.

St George&#8217;s Park is known to be one of South Africa&#8217;s most spinner-friendly wickets. And the Eastern Cape&#8217;s protracted drought isn&#8217;t helping matters. &#8220;This time of year in South Africa, with the heat and the wind, it&#8217;s a dry time, wickets don&#8217;t always offer what we are really looking for,&#8221; said Domingo. &#8220;It brings the opposition into the game a lot more. In that context, wickets in South Africa are probably fairer to the contest than most venues around the world.&#8221; That&#8217;s not necessarily the worst thing, especially since the Proteas &#8211; unlike others &#8211; perform quite well overseas. South Africa will be wary of underestimating the Sri Lankans&#8217; prowess on a fairer wicket but that doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re not excited to play in PE. &#8220;This is the ground where South Africa played it&#8217;s first Test ever in 1889. It&#8217;s got a wonderful history,&#8221; said Domingo. &#8220;Numerous players (like Dale Steyn, AB de Villiers and Quinton de Kock) made their debuts here too.
