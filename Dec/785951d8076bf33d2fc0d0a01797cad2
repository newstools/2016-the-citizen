A call for the SA Nursing Council to act has been made after a sister-in-charge at a Klerksdorp hospital ward allegedly handled a relative of a critically ill farm attack victim on Boxing Day in an unethical manner. However, a recording of the event showed that the nurse concerned was in fact polite and patient with the sister of the victim, although she was unwilling to provide telephonic information. The woman, whose name is known to The Citizen, recorded their conversation. The 25-year-old man was seriously wounded during a farm attack near Leeudoringstad, in North West, on Christmas Day and was admitted to Klerksdorp-Tshepong Hospital with two gunshot wounds to his mouth. DA MP and shadow minister of health Wilmot James yesterday said the party would lodge a complaint with the SANC for the &#8220;irregular and callous conduct&#8221; of the nurse. James said although there were no medical doctors available to make a proper assessment, the man was not referred to another hospital. &#8220;Patients go to hospitals to be treated, healed and dealt with the dignity that they as human beings deserve.&#8221; The MP lambasted the hospital, saying close relatives should have had access to information about their next-of-kin&#8217;s condition, as long as it did not interfere with their clinical treatment. &#8220;Hospitals are not prisons or concentration camps. The sister-on-duty in Ward 3 at that Klerksdorp-Tshepong Hospital Complex should be held to account for her callous and unethical conduct,&#8221; he said. The issue started when the patient&#8217;s sister phoned the hospital&#8217;s ward three times where he was admitted, wanting to know her brother&#8217;s condition. The nurse, who appeared to have knowledge of the patient&#8217;s case, told his sister that the young man was stable, but they were are trying to make him eat. But the lady was not prepared to take no for an answer, despite the fact that health worker told her that she was not allowed to talk about the matter as only the doctors were authorised to do so. The nurse offered that she could come herself and talk to the doctor about her brother. &#8220;The doctors are here, you want to talk to him &#8230; Dr Mbanda?&#8221; the nurse asked. The lady asked to speak to the doctor over the phone to understand why her brother was not given a feeding tube. The nurse refused, saying she was not allowed to let her talk to the doctor telephonically. The nurse said the sister must come herself to speak to the doctor directly on the same morning, otherwise during visiting hour at 3pm. &#8220;Are you not going to be able to come?&#8221; the nurse said. Their conversation ended without an agreement between them, as the distraught sister put the phone down. The woman was not immediately available for comment. &#8211; ericn@citizen.co.za
