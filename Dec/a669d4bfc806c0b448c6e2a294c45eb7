Mwanza. Tanzania, Norway and Denmark governments have agreed to amicably resolve the dispute between Tanzania Electric Supply Company (Tanesco) and two Scandinavian firms over the installation of 10 power generation turbines in Nyakato in 2013.The Sh129 billion, 60MW generators, were commissioned and started generating electricity in 2013 to offset shortages that resulted from reduced water levels in dams. Nyakato Power Plant Manager Ernest Nzemya told a delegation that from the beginning, three of the 10 turbines never functioned and another one development mechanical complications and stopped functioning completely earlier this year.This reduced power production capacity from 60MW to 36MW. Our efforts to try to reach an agreement on the way forward with the suppliers over the non-functioning turbines proved futile, Nzemya said.In fact, the failure of the heavy fuel oil powered turbines in 2013 brought about a blame game between Tanesco on one the hand and the two companies, Rolls Royce Company Limited form Norway and SEMCO from Denmark, on the other.While Tanesco said the four turbines stopped production because they were poorly installed, the two companies said Tanesco s lack of capacity to ensure constant maintenance of the turbines was to blame. Tanesco further alleges that the turbines that cost the Tanzania government Sh129 billion were of poor quality and furthermore, they were poorly installed.But on Monday the Minister for Energy and Minerals, Prof Sospeter Muhongo, who visited the power production site at Nyamagana District in Mwanza City accompanied by Norwegian ambassador Hanne-Marie Kaarstad and her Danish counterpart Einar Hebog rd Jensen, agreed to let the three parties work together to solve turbine problems.The Norwegian and Danish ambassadors said Tanesco should outline their grievances and submit them before February 28 next year, so that the companies involved in the installation of the equipment can work on them. Tanesco and the two companies have agreed that they will cooperate to ensure that the six functioning turbines continue to perform effectively and that they are timely maintained, Prof Muhongo said, revealing that there was a possibility that Tanesco could purchase more turbines from the same suppliers.About the three non-functioning turbines, Mr Muhongo said, Tanesco would list down their grievances so that the two suppliers look into the possibility of replacing them if repairing the same becomes impossible.
