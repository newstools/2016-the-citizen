President Jacob Zuma is expected to deliver the keynote address. Residents from various parts of the Vaal, including Sharpeville and Sebokeng were ferried in buses to the event. It hasn&#8217;t been a huge crowed attending the event. Some residents in Sharpeville made it clear that they were not going to attend, saying their area has always been forgotten by the ANC led government. However some of those who are in attendance, mostly elderly people say they decided to attend because of the role the ANC played in the fight against apartheid. Former President Nelson Mandela signed the country&#8217;s constitution into law in Sharpeville on this day in 1996 as a commemorative gesture in remembrance of the people who died during a peaceful demonstration against pass laws on March 21 1960. At the time, Mandela said the signing of the constitution marked the closure of a chapter of exclusion and a reaffirmation of our determination to build a society of which all of us can be proud of. Meanwhile the official programme was scheduled to commence at 10am on Saturday but it had not started by 11am. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
