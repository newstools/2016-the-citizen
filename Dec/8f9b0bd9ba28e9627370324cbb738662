President Jacob Zuma on Thursday received the Claassen inquiry report on former national police commissioner Riah Phiyega s fitness to hold office. The report was submitted to the President this morning [Thursday] by the chairperson of the Board of Inquiry, retired Judge Neels Johannes Claassen and members of the board, advocates Bernard Khuzwayo and Anusha Rawjee, the Presidency said in a statement. President Zuma will study the report and its recommendations in order to take any necessary action. Phiyega was suspended on full pay by Zuma more than a year ago. This after a commission, headed by retired Judge Ian Farlam to investigate police actions that led to the deaths of 44 people during an illegal mine workers strike at Lonmin mine in Marikana in August 2012, recommended that Phiyega face an inquiry into her fitness to hold office. The subsequent Claassen inquiry conducted its investigation and completed its work earlier this year. African News Agency (ANA)
