Mystery surrounds an incident in which a captain and co-pilot of a Boeing 737 cargo aircraft reported seeing what appeared to be a green object increasing in altitude past the cockpit of their aeroplane. A statement by the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) said the captain and co-pilot were flying from Cape Town International Airport to Port Elizabeth International Airport at the time of the sighting and that the green object increased in altitude past the cockpit of their aeroplane reaching to about a thousand feet into clouds above them and then returning towards earth at high speed past the cockpit of the aeroplane. NSRI said the sighting was reported to Air Traffic Control at Port Elizabeth International Airport who requested NSRI&#8217;s assistance at about 9.30pm on Monday to investigate the possibility that an aircraft or craft may be in difficulty. &#8220;NSRI Jeffreys Bay were alerted and although the matter was monitored throughout the night the green object has not been seen since and there are no reports of anyone, or craft or aircraft overdue or missing,&#8221; read the statement. &#8220;The incident occured approximately 10 nautical miles off-shore of Jeffreys Bay and 3 000 feet in the sky (1 000 metres) at first thinking this to perhaps be a 1 000 foot green parachute flare, but that was discounted as a 1 000 foot parachute flare (or 300 metres) cannot reach that height.&#8221; The NSRI said no further reports of sightings have been received and the incident remains a mystery.
