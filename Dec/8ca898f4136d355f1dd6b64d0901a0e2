The revelations and accusations aired before the parliamentary inquiry into the fitness of the SABC board to hold office bear sordid glimpses from insiders into just how broadly the rot had spread across the executive carpets at the public broadcaster s headquarters in Auckland Park. Allied to this is overlaid a wall of arrogance for those under interrogation by parliament that nothing seems able to pierce. There are important questions that require answers from a corporation that owes its true fealty to the citizens of this country, rather than the fat cat executives gorging on bloated bonuses.

And added to these allegations of an almost blanket endorsement of the abuse of power comes the question: why did they all wait so long? It will probably take even more time and much soul-searching on all sides before any definitive picture of what really went on and seemingly continues to do so emerges. We would suggest that the cynicism that has crept into the heart of this country s civil conscience will probably never fully be told. Or that the diehard opponents of the carnival on the hill the SABC has become would suggest that the mandated business of relaying news and views other than those of the ruling clique has long been an oxymoron. Consider this: a chairman without a board who refuses to leave the stage yet refuses to approach the footlights offered in parliament and a seemingly Teflon-coated individual who appears to swap roles and titles at a whim. If this is a mirror of our democracy, we are in more trouble than we thought.
