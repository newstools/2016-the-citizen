Talk about your spouse keeping you grounded! Andy Murray was voted the BBC Sports Personality of the Year for a record third time on Sunday night despite his wife kim telling him she was voting for one of his rivals. The 29-year-old Murray capped a memorable year in which he claimed his second Wimbledon and Olympic titles, deposed Novak Djokovic as world number one and became a father for the first time. He beat two-time Olympic triathlon champion Alistair Brownlee and Olympic showjumping gold medallist Nick Skelton in the public vote with the results announced at a ceremony in Birmingham. &#8220;Actually, I&#8217;ve got a bone to pick with my wife (Kim) because about an hour ago she told me she&#8217;d voted for Nick Skelton. Not smart from her with Christmas coming up,&#8221; said Murray . Murray , who also won the award in 2013 and 2015, added: &#8220;I&#8217;d like to thank everyone who voted &#8211; I really appreciate your support. &#8220;Also I&#8217;d like to thank my family. I think my mum is in the crowd there (in Birmingham). I&#8217;d like to thank my dad as as well, who just got married 10 days ago. &#8220;A huge thanks to my wife and my daughter (Sophia) &#8211; she won&#8217;t know what this means yet, but maybe in a few years she will.&#8221; Leicester City manager Claudio Ranieri was named coach of the year after guiding the Foxes to the Premier League title.
