If the Proteas&#8217; recent tour of Australia is anything to go by, having a player named Faf in your XI is a trump card. Faf du Plessis was indeed a thorn in the flesh. But next Thursday evening, the national cricket side will be wary of one turning out against them. Faf de Klerk, the Springboks&#8217; erratic scrumhalf, will be hoping to atone for his sins on the hapless Boks&#8217; poor European tour after being included in their squad for the Mandela Legacy Cup at Newlands in Cape Town. The Legacy Cup is a friendly game of T20 cricket between the two national sides that has been organised since January 2014 to honour South Africa&#8217;s first democratically-elected president as well as raising funds for the Nelson Mandela Foundation. Despite the obvious candy floss nature of the encounter, the Boks have proved decent opponents for the Proteas, whose bowlers are required to bowl from a shorter run-up. Pat Lambie, who will captain the Springboks, was a highly accomplished cricketer at school and will be joined by teammates like Damian de Allende and Conrad Jantjes, who also excelled with bat and ball. De Allende and Willie le Roux both took three wickets apiece in December 2014&#8217;s previous match, which was won by the Springboks after legendary lock Victor Matfield smashed an unbeaten 62. Du Plessis starred in the first match when his unbeaten 77 laid the platform for the Proteas&#8217; 14-run win in January 2014. &#8211; Sport Staff The squads are: Proteas: Hashim Amla, Mangaliso Mosehle, Faf du Plessis, JP Duminy, David Miller, Farhaan Behardien, Wayne Parnell, Dwaine Pretorius, Aaron Phangiso, Imran Tahir, Kyle Abbott.
