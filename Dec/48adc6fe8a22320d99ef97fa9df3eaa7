Muthambi apparently told the board it was because Motsoeneng had been acting for too long as chief operating officer. Lubisi was the first witness to testify before the ad hoc committee. He claimed that he was purged from the SABC board for questioning the board&#8217;s treatment of former public protector Thuli Madonsela s report When Governance and Ethics Fail released in 2014. As a result, Lubisi said he was incorrectly fingered for having a conflict of interest . My issue was that we were [still] busy dealing with the public protector&#8217;s report, which they did not want to implement, he said.

The SABC failed to inform the public protector of their compliance with the findings and the implementation of the remedial actions, which the board had agreed to, despite specific timelines in the report, Mkhwebane said.
