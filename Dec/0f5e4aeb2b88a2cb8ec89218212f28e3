Money is already tight in Plattekloof at the South African Rugby Union (Saru). Now they have to pay up for an injury the Springbok doctors missed. Also read: WATCH: Trevor Nyakane and Mangi Mosehle dance off at Newlands Worcester Warriors, a top English rugby club, are seeking compensation from the local federation for having to play without Francois Hougaard at the start of their new campaign. The Springbok utility back, who was picked for South Africa&#8217;s poor Rugby Championship campaign, returned to the club in mid-October with a shoulder injury that was only diagnosed after he went to for a routine check-up. Hougaard needed surgery and is only expected to be back on the field by January, even though he is ahead of his rehabilitation schedule. As a result, Worcester have missed out on the services of one their star players and now want compensation. Given that the Warriors have paid top dollar for Hougaard, Saru&#8217;s payment will probably have to be substantial &#8211; especially since it&#8217;s in British pounds.
