Western Cape Provincial Traffic Services said on Wednesday that this included a horrific accident that claimed the lives of 13 people near De Doorns on the day before Christmas. The victims were on their way to visit loved ones. Provincial traffic chief Kenny Africa said two children, aged one and five years old, were also knocked over and killed after being hit by cars on the West Coast.

Breath testing was performed on 1 365 drivers at 20 alcohol blitz roadblocks across the province. The highest breath-alcohol reading was recorded in the Mossel Bay service area. At 1.24 mg of alcohol per 1 000 ml of breath, this is five times over the legal limit of 0.24 mg/ 1 000 ml . Two people were arrested for speeding. In Laingsburg, a motorist was caught driving at 175km/h in a 120km/h zone. Africa said a total of 356 speeding offences were recorded and fines amounting to R340 750 were issued.
