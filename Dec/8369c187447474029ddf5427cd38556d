Racing at Scottsville is rarely easy and Wednesday s card is no exception. However, one could possibly take a chance in Race 5, a MR 90 Handicap over 1400m, and go with just two runners for the Pick 6 and Jackpot Spanish Captain and Roy s Winter Patch. It is usually the kiss of death to proclaim anything a two-horse race but even if something does split them, one of the two looks likely to win. Preference is for Spanish Captain who has an excellent record at Scottsville, he has raced there three times for one win, one second and one third and he has similar form over the distance. However, this will be the first time he is running over the course and distance. He was rested after finishing a 0.85-length fourth behind Nicklaus over 1600m at Greyville in June and made is comeback on 4 December in a MR 93 Handicap over 1200m at Scottsville. He ran on well over the final 400m and was beaten just a head by Sea Fever. Tony Rivalland s charge teams up with Brandon Lerena for the first time and that is also in his favour. He is riding at the top of his game although he is often greatly underrated by some pundits. Roy s Winter Patch is one of those runners who seems equally comfortable on turf or Polytrack although the majority of his wins have come on the latter surface. Nevertheless, he has won his only start over this Scottsville 1400m and comes into this race having won three of his last five starts. Keagan de Melo has only ridden the Yogas Govender-trained runner on one previous, occasion and that was in his course and distance win.
