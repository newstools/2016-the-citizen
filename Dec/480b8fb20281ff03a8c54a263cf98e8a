It is almost beyond belief that a 24-year-old South African rugby player contracted for an annual salary of not far south of $500 000 (R7 million), should turn his back on the game and retire. Springbok backline player Johan Goosen made his shock retirement announcement this weekend, turning his back on the game that had fed him royally, advancing as his reason the chance to take up a commercial director s job in South Africa. This has understandably incensed his French club, Racing 92, who believe they are owed more loyalty and one might hesitate, long-term return from a player they have invested so heavily in. There are two issues arising here. First: there is the miscomprehension that signing a contract in France is a soft option, ensuring talented South African players a nest egg to retire on. This is far from fact. The French work on a system along the lines of we pay, so you play. There is no free Gallic lunch. Second: though there might be more to the Goosen issue, it has done little for the cause of future contracts for players from this country. Racing are angry and making noises about suing.
