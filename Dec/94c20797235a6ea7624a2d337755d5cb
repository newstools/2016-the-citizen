Some difficult races await the punters this long weekend but we will take a shot at finding a few winning bets. The combination of trainer Duncan Howells and jockey Anton Marcus is always one that does very well and could give us a winning start as Brave Knight looks the one to be with in Race 1, a Maiden Plate over 1000m on the Greyville Polytrack on Friday. Brave Knight has done best over this course and distance and meets a very modest field. His biggest threat could come from the unraced Touch Wood. The Glen Kotzen-trained Magical Bet has run over a range of distances but the 1600m of Race 6, a MR 78 Handicap look like the ideal trip and he can follow up on his nice win this month. Magical Bet clearly ran well above his rating that day and the handicappers have smacked him with a seven-point penalty. Alyson Wright has her yard in fine form and her charge Roy s Pony improved nicely in her last start and could send punters home with the money as Race 8, a Maiden Plate over 2000m looks hers for the taking. This three-year-old filly improved with the step up to this distance last time out. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
