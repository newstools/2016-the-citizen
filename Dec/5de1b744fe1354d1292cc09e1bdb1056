Lotus FM listeners have had enough of local music, and now they just want the 90% local content quota that the SABC implemented to be scrapped. According to an online petition to &#8220;Save Lotus FM&#8221; started by the Indian community, the station has apparently lost its mandate, which was to be a &#8220;talk-focused Indian lifestyle station, reflecting the music, culture and lifestyle of the progressive South African Indian community&#8221;. However, the &#8220;sudden&#8221; move to &#8220;impose&#8221; the 90% local content on SABC radio stations has angered the Indian community, who say it has had &#8220;serious&#8221; negative implications for them. They further say it has affected the commercial sustainability of the station. According to the petition, Lotus FM has lost a third of its listenership, and there has been a decline in revenue since May 2016. This despite efforts made by the group to explain to the SABC why the station should have been exempted from 90% quota. &#8220;As if this was not enough the head of SABC, Hlaudi Motsoeneng has suggested that the name of Lotus FM should change. While under intense pressure, he has started to change his tune; the danger signs are very clear.&#8221; As a result,the community held a meeting last week and elected a Save Lotus FM committee, which has now created this online petition in a bid to have the station&#8217;s name retained and to scrap the 90% local music content quota &#8220;immediately&#8221;. &#8220;The subtle threats to close Lotus FM is condemned in the strongest possible terms.&#8221; Earlier this year, the SABC announced that it would play 90% local music across its radio stations. In a statement, the public broadcaster announced it met with various stakeholders in a bid to ensure prioritising more local content that reflected the diversity of South African cultures. The SABC will engage its audiences to evaluate whether the audiences are satisfied with these changes. This process will pave the way for the corporation to make an informed decision going forward, reads the statement.
