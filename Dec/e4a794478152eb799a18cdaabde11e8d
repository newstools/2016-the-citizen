Chad le Clos stormed to another convincing victory, raking in his fourth medal of the World Short-Course Championships in Windsor, Canada in the early hours of Sunday morning. The 24-year-old star, who was the only South African competing in a final on the penultimate day of competition, successfully defended his 50m butterfly title in 21.98. Tom Shields of the United States took the silver medal, touching the wall in 22.40. Le Clos had also retained the 100m and 200m butterfly crowns earlier in the week, and bagged silver in the 200m freestyle. The biennial short-course spectacle was set to come to a close on Monday morning.
