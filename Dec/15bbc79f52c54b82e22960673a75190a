Spokesperson Captain Frederick van Wyk said Manenberg SAPS Crime Prevention members and the Nyanga Cluster Project Team were deployed within the Manenberg Precinct to combat gang activity, focusing on illegal firearms and drugs. He said they were informed about illegal firearms at an address in Pecos Road. Members conducted a search of the premises and then did a thorough search of the back part of the premises, including digging up part of an informal dwelling, Van Wyk said. Two firearms and ammunition with serial numbers still in place, which had not been reported stolen, were found. A 35-year-old suspect, a known gang member, was arrested for the illegal possession of firearms and ammunition and would be appearing in court soon, he said. Police requested anyone with information on crime in the Manenberg area to come forward. African News Agency (ANA)
