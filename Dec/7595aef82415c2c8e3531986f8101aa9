The true iniquity inherent in the South African pay packet lies stranded somewhere in the middle of the official unemployment rate of 26.6% given as the 2016 figure and the vast amounts which land up in the pockets of elite executives. The National Union of Mineworkers vowed this week to continue the fight against what it terms the apartheid wage gap and high rewards granted Eskom executives, in the face of a Labour Court ruling against demands by the union and setting increases at 5.6%, upholding a Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration award in favour of the power utility. It is of interest to note in this regard that an Eskom electrician can earn between R127 828 and R275 964 annually, well above the highly controversial proposal for a R3 500 monthly minimum wage. This has surely to be measured against research that indicates the average executive in South Africa earns a basic salary of R4 million, jumping to R7 million with short- and long-term incentives included, while chief executives earn an average basic salary of R5.3 million, jumping to R9 million with incentives included. While there is an argument that these salaries are justified in terms of these executives supplying the impetus and sustainability to continue funding workers wages, it is clear there is a huge disparity in the comparative remuneration rates. The ongoing calls by unions for wage hikes have these figures to base their claims on, but this must also be taken in context. It is, after all, the mandate of union organisers to fight for the rights of their members and use all legal means to get the best deal possible for them as these officials have been mandated to do. The unacceptable unemployment figures are worrying enough on their own, but the combustible gulf between union demands and executive pay and perks is a veritable minefield.
