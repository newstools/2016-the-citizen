Former Liverpool midfielder Lee, 57, was brought in by Southgate&#8217;s predecessor Sam Allardyce, whose tenure lasted just 67 days after he was brought down by a newspaper sting. Lee worked alongside Southgate during the latter&#8217;s four-game interim stint at the helm, but having now been awarded a four-year contract, Southgate will look to appoint his own assistant. &#8220;I have great respect for Sammy,&#8221; Southgate said in an FA press release. &#8220;He is somebody who I worked with as a player and his personality and professionalism were excellent throughout my period as interim manager. &#8220;I felt it was important for me to bring in my own support team and Sammy fully respected that.&#8221; Lee said it had been a &#8220;great honour&#8221; to work with England. Southgate is reported to want Chelsea assistant coach Steve Holland to be his full-time number two.
