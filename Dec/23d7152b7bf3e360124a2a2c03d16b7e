A man shot and killed himself in an effort to avoid being arrested by members of the Tshwane Metro Police Department (TMPD). TMPD spokesperson Senior Superintendent Isaac Mahamba said the officers had held an operation yesterday in Mamelodi, east of Pretoria, when the incident occurred. The purpose of the operation was to catch people who drink and drive and those that are drinking in public. At about 2pm, the officers spotted four men sitting under a tree drinking. They approached them, but the men fled in differ ent directions, Mahamba said. He said the officers went after them and managed to catch three of them. When they approached the fourth man, he took out a firearm and fired about four shots at the officers. The officers called for backup and with the help of the community members, they managed to get him cornered. He then pointed the firearm at his own head and shot himself. He died on the spot, Mahamba said. No one else was injured during the incident. Police are investigating the apparent suicide.
