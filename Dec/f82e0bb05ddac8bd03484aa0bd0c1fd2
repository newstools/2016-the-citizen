The cricket was competitive and compelling but day one of the Test between the Proteas and Sri Lanka was soured by a, erm, sour Aussie. David Boon, the burly former Baggy Green top-order batter and now ICC match referee, decided to unceremoniously silence St George&#8217;s Park&#8217;s famous brass band. No-one quite knows why. No-one also quite knows who&#8217;s in charge after the first day&#8217;s play&#8230; Faf du Plessis won the toss &#8211; well, his counterpart Angelo Mathews called incorrectly &#8211; but there was doubt as to whether he made the correct decision. SA have won the toss &amp; will bat first. #ProteaFire #SAvSL pic.twitter.com/lvzXAQh3Vy &mdash; Cricket South Africa (@OfficialCSA) December 26, 2016 Always a risk choosing 2 do something after winning the toss based on trying 2 eliminate the opposition&#39;s strength. Hopefully won&#39;t backfire &mdash; daryn smit (@DarynSmit) December 26, 2016 There&#39;s plenty of grass on the St George&#39;s Park pitch but Faf du Plessis decided to bat &#8211; good decision? Should SA have bowled first? #SAvSL &mdash; SABC Sport (@SPORTATSABC) December 26, 2016 Views on the amount of fans that made it early to the ground differed markedly&#8230; How lovely does Port Elizabeth look? Perfect day for cricket. #SAvSL &mdash; Mindy Pawsey (@MKPS001) December 26, 2016 Watching #SAvSL from Australia. What a disappointment to see hardly a soul at the test, especially after the proteas performances of late. &mdash; Hylton Deon Ackerman (@ackershd) December 26, 2016 &nbsp; Initially, Suranga Lakmal looked like he might be typically erratic with the ball. How wrong that would turn out to be&#8230; None of the balls that Lakmal has bowled so far today would have gone on to hit the stumps #SAvSL &mdash; The Cricket Prof. (@CricProf) December 26, 2016 The Proteas opening pair negotiated the new ball well. Good job by SA openers Cook &amp; Elgar in 1st hour, 20 apiece, 40 without loss. SriLankan bowling steady but lacking much threat. slow movement &mdash; Ken Borland (@KenBorland) December 26, 2016 Stephen Cook-Dean Elgar with the first 50+ stand by South Africa&#39;s openers at Port Elizabeth since 2000#SAvSL https://t.co/TRbbgVkONw &mdash; ESPNcricinfo (@ESPNcricinfo) December 26, 2016 Stephen Cook ignored all the criticism over his &#8220;dodgy&#8221; technique by notching up a fine half-century. Stephen Cook follows up his Adelaide century with fifty on the first morning in Port Elizabeth. #SAvSL #cricket &mdash; Firdose Moonda (@FirdoseM) December 26, 2016 Alviro Petersen, who has a bit more spare time on his hands following his 2-year ban from cricket, was philosophical after lunch&#8230; #georgemichaelrip &mdash; Alviro Petersen (@AlviroPetersen) December 26, 2016 Cooky was out shortly afterwards after doing all the hard work. Suranga Lakmal has deserved that, best of the Sri Lankan bowlers, super ball, just nips away &amp; squares up Cook, caught behind for quality 59 &mdash; Ken Borland (@KenBorland) December 26, 2016 But at least there was an upside to his dismissal&#8230; If you&#39;ve had a rubbish 2016 then tune in to #SAvSL right now. Michael Holding on commentary, Hashim Amla batting. Will make it all better. &mdash; Alt Cricket (@AltCricket) December 26, 2016 Suddenly, Lakmal found his mojo. Fantastic post lunch spell from Suranga Lakmal. He has both the openers. Amla yet to score. Interesting period coming up. #SAvSL #cricket &mdash; Firdose Moonda (@FirdoseM) December 26, 2016 NOW THEN #SAvsSL &mdash; Six Sotyelelwa (@The_Sports_Jock) December 26, 2016 The world&#8217;s most reputable cricket website were quick to pounce on a statistical quirk regarding Dean Elgar. His poorest outing yet in PE! Dean Elgar&#39;s 1st innings scores at Port Elizabeth 45 v Sri Lanka 121 v Windies 83 v Aus 103* v New Zealand#SAvSL https://t.co/TRbbgVkONw pic.twitter.com/a71uEQ6eO2 &mdash; ESPNcricinfo (@ESPNcricinfo) December 26, 2016 JP Duminy was quick to counter Sri Lanka&#8217;s progress. Duminy putting on a driving clinic in PE. &mdash; stuart hess (@shockerhess) December 26, 2016 And then David &#8220;Grinch&#8221; Boon stole the spirit of the Test match &#8230; or at least part of it. Word filtering through that match referee David Boon has ordered band at St. George&#39;s to stop playing during overs. #SAvSL Not very festive &mdash; Gerald Imray (@GeraldImrayAP) December 26, 2016 Don&#39;t be fooled. David Boon looks jovial like Santa Claus but he&#39;s actually a grinch. The match referee has banned the PE band from playing &mdash; Ken Borland (@KenBorland) December 26, 2016 At least not all holidaymakers in the Bay were on the beach. CSA has confirmed that 6515 have turned out for day one of the first Test in PE. Catch our tea time chat now on @sabc3 pic.twitter.com/IxbRy9EZpr &mdash; SABC Sport (@SPORTATSABC) December 26, 2016 Hashim Amla&#8217;s poor form continued with a painstaking 20. Hashim Amla. Yea though he walks through the valley of the shadow of form, he will still stick around for 76 balls and score some runs. &mdash; Ami Kapilevich (@biobot) December 26, 2016 In contrast, Duminy was simply serene. JP Duminy 50* off 73 balls, seen some of his best strokeplay here, 9&#215;4. South Africa 188-3, important he goes on to something big from here &mdash; Ken Borland (@KenBorland) December 26, 2016 Until he decided to play a sweep shot out of the blue. Disappointing end to a quality innings by JP Duminy. Herath in the game. If Sri Lanka get Du Plessis before stumps, they will be happy &mdash; Jon Cardinelli (@jon_cardinelli) December 26, 2016 Suranga Lakmal kept on roaring. These are career best figures for Suranga Lakmal, Prev best 4-79 vs Pak, 2014 #SAvSL &mdash; The Cricket Prof. (@CricProf) December 26, 2016 Good comeback by the Sri Lankans after the first session. &mdash; stuart hess (@shockerhess) December 26, 2016 And we&#8217;re still scratching our heads as to who&#8217;s in the ascendancy&#8230; (sort of) Absorbing day here at St George&#39;s Park. Probably Sri Lanka&#39;s. SA 267 for 6 with no centurions. #SAvSL &mdash; Firdose Moonda (@FirdoseM) December 26, 2016 For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter. &nbsp;
