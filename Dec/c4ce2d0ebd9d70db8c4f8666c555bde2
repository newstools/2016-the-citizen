A man was hacked to death in Marikana near Rustenburg, North West police said on Friday. Police spokesperson Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone said a group of people attacked the man with sharp objects and pangas at Marikana West on Thursday afternoon. The man died as a result of serious injuries he sustained. The motive of the incident is still unknown and investigation is underway. No one has been arrested, he said. Police in Marikana were investigating a case of murder. North West premier Supra Mahumapelo denounced the incident. We view this heartless incident as a deliberate and senseless attack on the provincial government s reconciliation, healing and renewal programme, more so the second phase of this programme was rolled out at Wonderkop near Marikana this past Sunday. These are opportunistic criminal acts, which we call on the police to leave no stone unturned in investigating, said Mahumapelo. He called on the residents of Marikana to remain calm, fearless and united, and urged them to help police with information that would lead to the apprehension of perpetrators who were still at large. Killers have no place in our society. They must be apprehended and face the full might of the law. African News Agency For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
