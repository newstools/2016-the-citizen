Since readmission to world football in June 1993, an incredible revolving door has let a total of 23 coaches walk into the national team s changeroom. Starting with Stanley Tshabalala and ending with the sacking of Shakes Mashaba this week and despite the nomenclature changing at times from interim to caretaker that still adds up to close on one man in the Bafana coaching hot seat each year. It would be simplistic to point out that this is hardly a recipe for calm continuity or, we would like to suggest even an embryonic formula for developing either a style to suit South African football, or to generate a succession programme to integrate our top players into the rigours of international football. What we so desperately need from Safa, the body which administers the game in this country, is to cancel its grandiose-sounding schemes of Vision This and Operation That and start building from scratch. It can hardly matter at this juncture in our football history we are the 12th-ranked side in Africa and 60th on the global listings, so it cannot surely be a case of protecting our virtually non-existent base. Mashaba, having had two regular shots and an interim outing as Bafana coach, has had his day. But when the tempers have cooled at Safa House, there is surely a forum for some of the past coaching knowledge to be funnelled back in advancing our claims to being a great footballing nation. It is time for a coach to be given the leeway to have an extended grab on the reins and start a building process which has a coherent path into the future. The sooner a new coach is appointed and given solid backing the better, for clearly we cannot take the path of minimal return that has been the norm.
