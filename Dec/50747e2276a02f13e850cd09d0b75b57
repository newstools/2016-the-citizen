It is inconceivable that SABC chair Mbulaheni Maguvhe who is, after all, a degreed associate professor at Unisa, claims blanket ignorance as defence of the shenanigans happening at the public broadcaster and smacks of a somewhat shallow cop-out. Somehow, for an academic, not examining the sources of the research he must surely have been tasked to do in the normal course of his work is, quite honestly, inconceivable. Yet facing a parliamentary inquiry into the affairs of the corporation, Maghuve pleaded ignorance on more than one important aspect of the governance of a state entity bleeding an annual R400 million from the public purse.

As for the SABC s procurement policies and recruitment criteria, Maguvhe again claimed no knowledge. An ignorance of the respect due to parliament also seemed to be lacking. If the growing evidence of irregularities recounted to the House of Assembly is any indication, then there seems to be gaps in the expertise needed to run the public broadcaster no amount of hasty lectures in governance 101 are likely to fill.
