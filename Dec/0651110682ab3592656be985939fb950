David Pocock, the Wallaby flanker who sunk the Springboks in 2011&#8217;s Rugby World Cup quarterfinal, is taking a year&#8217;s break from international rugby to go back to Zimbabwe. It&#8217;s in stark contrast to many other expats, who try to avoid the embattled country at all costs. The 28-year-old ball-poacher though is known for being a bit eccentric and is a prominent social activist. As a result, Pocock came to an agreement with the Australian Rugby Union (ARU) to grant him leave of 12 months in order to participate in numerous &#8220;conservation projects&#8221;. &#8220;I&#8217;m a bit of a weirdo so I&#8217;m happy with that, that&#8217;s okay,&#8221; he told reporters in London this week. &#8220;Rugby is certainly something that I really enjoy but I think like everyone I&#8217;m interested in other things and I feel pretty lucky to be able to take some time off to be able to pursue them and then get back into rugby.&#8221; Pocock also wants to visit his grandfather, who is one of the commercial farmers that has been targeted by Zimbabwe president Robert Mugabe&#8217;s controversial land reform programme. Ian Ferguson, his maternal grandfather, decided to keep hold of the family&#8217;s citrus farm and recently won a 15-year legal battle against the government. &#8220;He&#8217;s got a real love of the land and he&#8217;s not going anywhere,&#8221; said Pocock. &#8220;That&#8217;s kind of what he&#8217;s doing with his life at the moment &#8211; trying to hold on.&#8221; Pocock will return to competitive rugby in 2018.
