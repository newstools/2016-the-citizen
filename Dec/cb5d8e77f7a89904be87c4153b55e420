CCTV footage has emerged of a group of suspects stealing liquor from a bar and breaking into a church in Nelson Mandela Bay. The Herald Live reported that the suspects &#8220;could easily qualify as Nelson Mandela Bay s dumbest criminals&#8221;, as their actions are recorded in full view of CCTV cameras, with at least one of the suspects&#8217; faces in full view, despite that he is wearing gloves that are presumed to prevent him from leaving fingerprints at the scene. A screenshot of one of the suspects facing the camera, yet wearing gloves. Picture: Herald Live&#8217;s YouTube Channel Herald Live spoke to the owner of the beachfront restaurant the suspects robbed, Finnezz Fusion Cafe, at Humerail, and manager Johan Rheeder was quoted as saying: &#8220;There was cash on the premises and a laptop under the counter, but they only took the booze [worth about R7 000].&#8221; It was further reported that the suspects made off with costly liquor such as Hennessy cognac and Glen Moray whisky. Police reportedly confirmed that they were investigating the case of break-in at the cafe. A pastor further told Herald Live that a staff member watched the video footage of the suspects robbing the cafe and believed that the same suspects were alleged to have been seen on the church&#8217;s video footage breaking into the church and stealing a 55-inch television set. A case has been opened. It is believed that the suspects broke into the church about 90 minutes after breaking into the restaurant on December 12.
