The decision announced at Sun City this week that professional golfer Sally Little has been inducted in the South African Hall of Fame is probably long overdue. Arguably the most charming of this country s sporting ambassadors, Cape Town-born Little proved far and away our most successful woman golfer over an amateur and professional career spanning 28 years. She won two LPGA Major titles the Women s PGA Championship in 1980 and the Du Maurier Classic in 1988 the rookie of the year award in 1971, the year she took the plunge and packed her clubs for America and the paid ranks, as well as recording a total of 17 career wins worldwide. Her innate talent was always there and as an amateur she was the low individual at the 1971 World Amateur Team Championship and won the South African matchplay and strokeplay titles, as well as ending tied for fifth at the 1971 Lady Carling Open, finishes which convinced her to turn professional. But there was far more to Little than pure talent. Asked why she had succeeded when so many talented South African women players had flared and faded, her answer was succinct. Work ethic, she replied. Without it you get nowhere. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
