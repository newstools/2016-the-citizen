Festive season traffic volumes are expected to pick up from today, the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) said. With many people looking forward to their holidays, the RTMC has repeated its call for motorists to abide by the rules of the road. This follows the alarming death toll from last week s start of the festive season, which has the RTMC worried. Spokesperson Simon Zwane this week told The Citizen that reckless and drunk driving were among the leading causes of road carnage. He said past experience also suggested that most vehicles involved in accidents would be driven by motorists aged between 20 and 40. Since the festive season started, there have been accidents in all nine provinces, but we cannot give an exact number of people who died because some might still be in hospital. But the carnage is worrying, Zwane said. We want to urge all motorists to avoid embarking on journeys late at night or during early morning. According to Zwane, the riskiest travel times were between 9pm and midnight and between 4am and 5am. This past weekend, 16 people lost their lives in separate accidents in Limpopo, Eastern Cape and the Free State. Zwane said traffic officials would be out in force this festive season, warning that those found transgressing road rules would face the full might of the law . Traffic officers had already started conducting road blocks in various parts of Gauteng. During the previous festive season, 1 147 fatal crashes were recorded between last December 1 and January 5.
