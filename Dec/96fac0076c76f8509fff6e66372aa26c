After President Jacob Zuma last week asked the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) to probe the rural Limpopo municipality for maladministration and corruption, The Citizen has established that ANC bigwigs in the province have been fingered in corruption. The goings-on at the Mopani District Municipality have been the focus of many media expos s. Last year, The Citizen reported that one of South Africa s longest-serving former municipal managers, Tim Maake, was blamed for emptying the municipality s coffers, leaving no money to pay staff salaries. Zuma has authorised the SIU to investigate improper and unlawful conduct by councillors, officials and employees of the municipality, among other things. There are allegations that a senior official at the municipality, who cannot be named for legal reasons, awarded a sanitation project to a company which did not bid for the job. Municipal spokesperson Neil Shikwambana said the council was busy with remedial actions against the bid committee members for this oversight. The duty to award tenders lies solely with the municipal manager after considering the recommendations from the bid committees, he said. The company in question did bid for a sanitation project in Greater Tzaneen and both the bid evaluation and adjudication committees recommend the company to be appointed in Greater Tzaneen as per its bid. However upon the issuing out of appointment letters, there was an oversight and the company was instead appointed in Greater Giyani. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
