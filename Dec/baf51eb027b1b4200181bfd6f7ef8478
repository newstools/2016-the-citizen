You can&#8217;t always have it your way. And that&#8217;s no bad thing for the Blitzboks after they beat the United States 28-10 in their second pool game of the Cape Town Sevens on Saturday. Following an easy win over Russia earlier, allied to the last week&#8217;s title win in Dubai, South Africa have felt rather invincible the past few days for their fans.

That translated into a try for the USA after Maka Unufe exploited Perry Baker&#8217;s nifty handling. The hosts woke up after that, tightened up and created opportunities through counterattacking play. Werner Kok was the biggest beneficiary with two tries as South Africa eventually recorded a decent victory. It means they have already reached Sunday&#8217;s quarterfinals and will look to finish top of their group when they meet Australia at 19:54. Point-scorers: Blitzboks (14) &#8211; Tries: Werner Kok (2), Cecil Afrika, Seabelo Senatla. Conversions: Branco du Preez (3), Justin Geduld. USA (5) &#8211; Try: Maka Unufe, Danny Barrett.
