The folks at BMW are expanding their SUV lineup with the addition of the X2, which will be slotted snugly between the X1 and X3. The good news is that the X2 concept we saw at the Paris Motor Show back in September will be looking pretty much the same as the production run set to arrive in 2018. . The &#8220;Sports Activity Vehicle&#8221; will ride on the same XKL platform that underpins the X1, but introduce a flashier look, and even more performance options. In the transfer from concept to production, though, rumours suggest that it shouldn t lose much of that unique styling. Apart from the departure of features such as 21-inch wheels and angular headlights, the unique kidney grille, the angular roofline and the sharper fascia should remain. The introduction of a roof spoiler and a higher waistline that transitions into a new set of taillights will also accompany the production version. . Under the hood, the X2 will share its engines with the smaller X1, including the 1.5-litre inline-three turbo, the 2.0-litre inline-four turbo, and the 2.0-litre inline-four diesel turbo. Front-wheel drive will be offered on the base sDrive18d variant, while all-wheel-drive will be available on all other trims. BMW is even considering a sporty M-performance X2 model down the line, which could use a more powerful version of the already available 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine. . The X2 will make its debut towards the end of 2017 and will be aimed at a younger audience with its fresh design and powerful-enough engines.
