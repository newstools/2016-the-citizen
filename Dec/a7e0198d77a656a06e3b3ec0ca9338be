Two women and a man have been arrested after they were found in possession of 30 South Africa Social Security Agency (Sassa) cards and a large amount of cash. Kempton police spokesman Captain Jethro Mtshali confirmed the incident, saying members of the Benoni Flying Squad were summoned to Emperors Palace in Kempton Park last week Monday where the suspects were caught, Kempton Express reported. An alert security guard working at the entertainment venue noticed two women and a man withdrawing cash at an ATM, using different debit cards, said Mtshali. On arrival, the flying squad searched the trio and found the Sassa cards and cash. The suspects, aged 31, 32 and 36, could not provide the officers with a satisfactory explanation as to how the debit cards, belonging to different account holders, came into their possession. Investigations are ongoing. &#8211; Caxton News Service For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter .
