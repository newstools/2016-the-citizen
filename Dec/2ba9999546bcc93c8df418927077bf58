DJ Shimza, real name Ashley Raphala, is set to host his sixth annual One Man Show (OMS) at the Mehlareng Stadium in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, on Christmas Day. But the popular show goes beyond the entertainment factor. The 27-year-old DJ and music producer also uses the OMS to uplift and give back to his Tembisa community. The show has looked after hundreds of disadvantaged children, paying for their school uniforms while taking the pressure off struggling caregivers, DJ Shimza said. The concept arose out of concern for the numerous homes in Tembisa housing orphaned children struggling to get sustained support from government or the private sector. Using his crowd-pulling star power, Shimza introduced the first show at the Caprivi Music Lounge in Tembisa. The funds raised were used to buy children s school uniforms and to tackle the operational costs of several orphanages, Shimza said. This year, we are looking to generate enough money for more than 1 000 children. The DJ said fans could expect an electric show, with music from his 2015 debut album featuring the likes of Dr Malinga, among other artists. And despite several accomplishments under his belt, the Metro FM DJ remains one of the most humble entertainers. His passion not only shines through in his work, but extends to addressing the needs of his community. Shimza s OMS gig last year drew more than 12 000 people, and is expected to attract an even bigger crowd this year. The show had previously featured the likes of Bucie, Mpumi, Black Motion, Cassper Nyovest, DJ Sbu, Major League DJz, AKA and Boom Shaka. OMS tickets are available at Computicket from R150 (general) and R300 (VIP) to R1 500 (VVIP). For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
