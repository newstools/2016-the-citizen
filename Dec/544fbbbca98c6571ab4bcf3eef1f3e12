The SAHETI matric class of 2016 achieved 202 distinctions, representing 36% of the overall subject results (2.8 distinctions per candidate). In addition to the 100% pass rate and 99% degree pass, SAHETI boasts five full house distinction passes. The school is an English-medium, independent school that describes itself as &#8220;promoting the ethos and values of Hellenism&#8221;. Hellenism deals with &#8220;the national character or culture of Greece, especially ancient Greece&#8221;. The school was established in 1974 by a group of founders under the leadership of Greece-born social justice legend Advocate George Bizos. It says: &#8220;Its doors were open to all, welcoming widely diverse communities to share in its values-driven, universal education.&#8221; The full-house distinction pass candidates wrote eight or nine subjects, achieving 90% in many of them. The school s top achiever, Michael Stephanou, achieved full-house distinctions and ensured that each of those were within the A+ category. Furthermore, 73% of SAHETI s matrics registered for more than the mandatory seven subjects: 49% of the group wrote eight, 21% wrote nine, while two pupils wrote 10. The ethos at SAHETI is to motivate a belief that a positive mind-set can yield excellence. And academics constitute a central fibre of this tradition.
