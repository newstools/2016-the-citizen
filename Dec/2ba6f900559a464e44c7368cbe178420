Chaos is set to continue in the City of Johannesburg in 2017 unless the ANC and DA smoke a peace pipe. However, yesterday the ANC vowed that the two parties would never kiss and make up. No peace pipe until socioeconomic transformation is realised, ANC Johannesburg region spokesperson Jolidee Matongo told The Citizen yesterday. Yes, the DA can rest assured that 2017 will be an even tougher year in their temporary governance of the city, if they finish the year at all. In response, DA Johannesburg regional chairperson Khume Ramulifho said it is clear that the ANC wants to hide its corruption. The ANC must continue to be irrelevant and will lose support in the process, while the DA is building a city with opportunities as a caring government in Joburg, said Ramulifho. The DA s focus is to provide opportunities to all residents in Joburg. Ramulifho wished the ANC luck with its plans to make the DA irrelevant. Following the recent fallout over the collapse of council meetings, relations between the rival parties came to a grinding halt, leading to the two parties criticising each other publicly. The dispute surfaced after a DA-led coalition government in Johannesburg under mayor Herman Mashaba decided to cancel projects initiated by the former mayor and the ANC s regional chairperson in Joburg, Parks Tau. Programmes such as Jozi@work, a programme aimed at empowering community enterprises and improving service delivery, were deemed vanity projects of the past administration. The ANC even labelled the DA s City of Joburg speaker, Vasco Da Gama, incompetent and said he was afraid to rule against EFF councillors.
