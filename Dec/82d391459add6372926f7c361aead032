The Warriors will be looking to pick themselves up from a Farhaan &#8216;Fudge&#8217; Behardien hangover when they host the Highveld Lions in the domestic T20 competition&#8217;s play-off at St George s Park in Port Elizabeth on Tuesday. The Eastern Cape franchise suffered at the hands of a record-breaking knock by the Titans&#8217; Proteas star on Sunday when he smashed a 14-ball 50 the fastest ever in domestic 20-over history. The consequences of that innings in the final round of pool matches is that Mark Boucher&#8217;s defending champions leapfrogged the Warriors to top spot and an automatic berth in the final, which they will host on Friday.

We re certainly disappointed with the way things turned out on the day, said Maketa. Farhaan played very well and to play the way he did in a five-over game, it was really something special and something we knew at halfway would be difficult to match. But it s done and dusted now and we re grateful that it s an even quicker turnaround this week. We just need to focus and ensure that we pitch up on Tuesday. &nbsp; The Lions are pushing for the inclusion of their South Africa star, Kagiso Rabada, although it will not be the end of the world if he does not play. Their bowlers were the big reason they overcame the BuildNat Cape Cobras by 22 runs on Sunday after they defended a modest 140 in Paarl. I thought our batting was poor, but the bowlers were outstanding, their coach Geoffrey Toyana added. To come to Paarl and beat a quality Cobras team was extremely satisfying. So we re thrilled to be in the play-offs. The Warriors are a good team, but we feel we have some good momentum with us. It will be a tight game in PE.
