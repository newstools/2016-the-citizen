Anglican Church archbishop Thabo Makgoba was taken to task by top ANC man Mzwanele &#8216;Jimmy&#8217; Manyi after the church rejected the call for religious institutions to stay away from politics. Makgoba, while addressing congregants on Christmas Day, said the church had resolved to ignore President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s call for the church to desist from participating in politics. The president said the role of the church was to pray for politicians and peace. Makgoba told the church: I am very pleased that the bishops and their chapters in the three Western Cape dioceses Cape Town, False Bay, and Saldanha Bay have rejected President Zuma s comments and have told him very firmly, No Mr President, we will not refrain from engagement in the political terrain&#8217;.&#8221; On Twitter, Manyi asked the archbishop about his position on land in the South African context. Makgoba responded by saying that we needed a &#8220;land Codesa of sorts&#8221;. When asked about Section 25 of the Constitution, which states: &#8220;No one can have their property [including land] taken away from them unless this is done according to a law,&#8221; the archbishop said: &#8220;I will have to go and read and refresh the detail.&#8221; Section 25 prohibits, among other things, expropriation of land without compensation, a policy stance on land the EFF disagrees with. On the expropriation on land, the constitution clearly states: The government can take a person s land away from them if: It needs the land for public purposes, or It is in the public s interest, for example, if the government needs the land for its land-reform programme. If the government takes land from a person they must pay the person compensation. Morning Arch. Put differently, if you had that land codesa of sorts what would the Church be advocating for?@ArchbishopThabo @News24 &mdash; Mzwanele Manyi (@MzwaneleManyi) December 26, 2016 Once you have refreshed Arch, please let me know so that we can discuss from the &#39;same&#39; level of information.@ArchbishopThabo @News24 &mdash; Mzwanele Manyi (@MzwaneleManyi) December 26, 2016
