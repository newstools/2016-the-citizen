One salient point which came out of the Blitzboks ending triumphantly in the Dubai leg of the World Seven Series at the weekend, is how comfortable the players were in what they do, and how their team-mates around them contribute to the combined effort. No team at odds with itself would have been able to hand out an almost unprecedented 40-0 whitewash of an All Black Sevens outfit in the quarterfinals, then hand out a comprehensive 36-5 hiding to a good Welsh side in the semifinals. It gives more than just a good idea of what is required. But the South Africans saved the best for last, when they came up against Rio Olympic gold medal winners, the rightly feared Fijians, in the final. Going 14-0 up in the opening minutes was one thing. But coming back from two well-worked tries by the Fijians to tie the scores, provided the springboard for the Blitzboks to prove their real worth. Far from being intimidated by the physical presence of the Pacific islanders, the Boks showed the confidence of their coaching and conditioning, and came back even harder, scoring two more tries to wrap it up. Here is certainly something for other South African sides to take note of.
