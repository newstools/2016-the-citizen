The SABC s discordant one-man boardroom band continues to play blithely on, ignoring the lyrics of reality, which surely dictate that the concert has ended and the curtain call sounded. The walkout by Mbulaheni Maguvhe, the chairperson and solitary survivor of the remains of the board of the public broadcaster, presents a new and we would hazard to say arrogant crescendo to what has been a saga of sorry egos totally out of sync with the real world. Despite any reservations Hlaudi Motsoeneng, now waving his baton as the grandly sounding head of corporate affairs, might have and the misconception that decisions can be made, the SABC chair is an out-oftune soloist sadly in need of the required orchestration demanded from a quorum. Just who makes the decisions on the day-to-day tempo of the towering edifice west of Johannesburg, remains anyone s guess. And despite the raised voice by ANC chief parliamentary whip Jackson Mthembu, there seems very little the politicians with political will can do to drag the band back into unwilling harmony. Certainly the SABC is performing to the sound of one hand clapping as the fractured band plays on and on. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
