Rugby fans who believe Sevens rugby is a form of the game reserved for specialists can rejoice: the Blitzboks have gone for the tried and tested for the Dubai leg of the new World Sevens Series season starting Friday. Despite winning the bronze medal at this year&#8217;s Rio Olympics, many believed Neil Powell&#8217;s national Sevens side did themselves a disservice by trying to incorporate reputable players from the 15-man format into their structures. Players like the Stormers duo of Cheslin Kolbe and Juan de Jongh as well as the Springbok utility back Francois Hougaard eventually were deemed good enough to go to Brazil but South Africa&#8217;s mediocre showing led to critics believing more &#8220;sevens specialists&#8221; should&#8217;ve been included. Last year we started introducing some established fifteens guys into our structure as we looked at finding the right combinations for the Olympic Games, said Powell. This time around, we arrived with a squad full of sevens regulars. In fact, four of the five most experienced players ever in the Blitzbok shirt are in Dubai, so a lack of experience will definitely not be an issue. We have some solid performers that has done well at this level. Cecil Afrika (2011), Werner Kok (2015) and Seabelo Senatla (2016) were named World Sevens Players of the Year in the past and all three are looking very sharp in training.&#8221; Yet there&#8217;s no guarantee that the Blitzboks will have more stability than last season. Various key members such as Senatla and the diminutive Kwagga Smith, the Lions&#8217; captain in the latter stages of this year&#8217;s Currie Cup, have already indicated they wish to concentrate more on their 15-man game in 2017. Will that distract them from their Sevens responsibilities? Whilst their group &#8211; featuring Uganda, Scotland and the United States &#8211; can&#8217;t necessarily be considered one of heavyweights, it is an unpredictable one. &#8220;I don t have to point out the dangers of facing Scotland, we all know what happened in our previous clash &#8211; losing the London Sevens after the final buzzer, said Powell. We will be up for this one. The USA remains one of the most dangerous teams on the circuit. They can really hurt you with their pace and counter-attack, so we need to be clinical and have no tolerance for mistakes, either on attack or defence.&#8221; Blitzboks: Chris Dry, Philip Snyman, Dylan Sage, Kwagga Smith, Werner Kok, Kyle Brown, Branco du Preez, Rosco Speckman, Justin Geduld, Cecil Afrika, Ruhan Nel, Seabelo Senatla.
