The land of Stars and Stripes will soon beckon for Kevin Lerena after Rodney Berman signed a promotional deal with Art Pelullo of Banner Promotions on Wednesday. Both promoters said the agreement would kick off with Lerena boxing in the US in the first quarter of 2017. Said Pelullo: The cruiserweights are finally getting attention in the US. I like the look of Lerena and he can box, so the plan is to take him to new heights. Pelullo and Berman thrashed out the deal at this week s WBC convention in Miami. The American is known as the People s Promoter and has honed top careers like Ruslan Provodnikov, Ricky Hatton, Demetrius Andrade, Willie Monroe jr and Acelino Freitas. Banner recognise Kevin for what he is: a dynamic and fresh talent who can make waves in an exciting division, said Berman. It s all up to Kevin. He has some business to do in February, after which the sky is the limit. Indeed, Lerena co-features in the main event at Emperors Palace on February 4 and needs to overcome the considerable talent of Vikapita Meroro before he can shift his gaze to America.
