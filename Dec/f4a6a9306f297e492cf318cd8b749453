Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone said the goods train travelling from Kimberley in the Northern Cape to Mahikeng, with three occupants allegedly hit a cow that was on the railway line and two locomotives capsized on Wednesday. The place where the locomotives capsized is full of water due to a nearby pan following a heavy rainfall. One of the occupants is reported to be dead. Apparently, at the time of the incident, the railway line was also covered by water, said Mokgwabone. Transnet could not be immediately reached for comment.
