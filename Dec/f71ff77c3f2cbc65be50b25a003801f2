A &#8220;friend&#8221; of Michael Schumacher is trying to give the world a glimpse into his current condition &#8230; whilst also making lots of money. Various European media outlets have reported the individual is allegedly trying to sell a photograph of the legendary F1 driver recovering at his home in Switzerland for approximately R17.5 million. Schumacher&#8217;s health has been a mystery since he sustained major brain injuries after a skiing accident in December 2013. The &#8220;friend&#8221; had apparently taken a camera with him during a visit and secretly snapped a few shots before &#8220;smuggling&#8221; the images out of the house and selling them to bidders. The Prosecutor&#8217;s Office in Offenburg, a town in the south of Germany close to the Swiss border, confirmed an &#8220;unknown person&#8221; was trying to sell photographs of Schumacher. Police are investigating. Sabine Kehm, Schumacher&#8217;s manager, remained mum on any details regarding his health. &#8220;Michael&#8217;s health is not a public issue and therefore we will not comment on it,&#8221; she said. Schumacher was in a chemically-induced coma for six months before returning to his home, where he reportedly still remains paralysed.
