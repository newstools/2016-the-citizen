Penny Sparrow, who made headlines at the start of this year for comparing black people to monkeys, is yet to pay the fines she was ordered by the courts to pay as punishment. In June she was ordered by the equality court to pay R150 000 within 60 days to the Oliver and Adelaide Tambo Foundation after being found guilty of hate speech. The foundation however told TimesLive on Thursday that it had not received payment from Sparrow. She also pleaded guilty to a charge of crimen injuria in the Scottburgh Magistrate&#8217;s Court in September and was fined R5 000 or 12 months imprisonment in addition to two years imprisonment suspended for five years. She also had to apologise publicly and on Facebook. Department of justice and correctional services spokesperson Mthunzi Mhaga told TimesLive she was yet to pay any fines. She has reportedly applied for condonation and leave to appeal. She has previously said that she doesn&#8217;t have enough money to afford the fines. It appears that a widely reported-on campaign to raise money for her did not achieve that objective. An emotional Sparrow, who is 68 years old, read out her letter of apology in court. She said: I wish to make a public apology for my thoughtless behaviour. I have hurt the feelings of my fellow South Africans. I realise that what I have done is wrong. I am very sorry.
