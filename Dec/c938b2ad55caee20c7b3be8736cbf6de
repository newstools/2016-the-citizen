On this special day for all South Africans across the racial, language, financial and cultural divides that continue to build frustrating walls, it is vital to underscore the difference between reconciliation, recrimination and restitution. The Day of Reconciliation should be a time when we spend just a small portion of what has been granted us as a day of rest to reflect on even the smallest of improvements in how we view and respect our fellow citizens. And while this should be a time of ubuntu, togetherness and toenadering, the noble purpose of the day is often difficult to keep in focus when the corrupt robber barons are left at large to plunder the remnants of a battered economy. It is almost impossible to reconcile when there are increasing indications that the rule of law, along with fair and sensible governance are being eroded. It is equally difficult to keep in focus when ministers and high government appointees profess ignorance of what is happening within the umbrella of the mandate they have been handed to shield those citizens with less political voice. Or when a clamorous chorus of diverse demands some of them in the areas of health, education and infrastructure, we would suggest with every right scramble to make themselves heard. But at this juncture, we need to stop and take a look at the unassailable fact of what we have accomplished as a nation since 1994. It is a trip which has shown that, while we might have stridently divergent voices, we have survived as a people. Reconciliation is purely a start to redressing past wrongs. It is a difficult journey we must embark on anew every day, not just for an isolated 24 hours once a year.
