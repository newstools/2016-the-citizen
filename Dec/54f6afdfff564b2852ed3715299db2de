Apart from Bonang Matheba being accused by poet Ntsiki Mazwai for lying about a threatening e-mail she allegedly sent her, SA celebrities have apparently told many lies. Twitter on Sunday set out to expose the lies some of our celebs have told and thought we wouldn&#8217;t know. The most common lie told by most celebrities has been about how none of them had a good upbringing. All of them have told stories about their poverty-stricken backgrounds and how they had to work their way to the top. Still on their backgrounds, apparently most celebrities have a lot of people back home depending on them too. Most of these who lie about their backgrounds also use that as an excuse to say they are not doing whatever they&#8217;re famous for for the fame. It&#8217;s all about their passion and dreams, they have said, until they get to a place with a long queue and want preferential treatment. Anyway, Twitter has asked why they don&#8217;t follow their fans back if it&#8217;s not about the fame. In fact, where are all those awards they have won for the fans? Let&#8217;s not even get to those who have lied about the people they were dating, and again Matheba is one of these, after suing DJ Zinhle for saying she was dating AKA. She released a full statement denying that they were dating, and then, obviously, because the truth really does not like staying in the dark, it came out in the end. According to Twitter, there are celebrities who have lied about the cars and houses they own. Most of these are said to be hip hop artists, who rap about the beautiful women and cars and money they don&#8217;t even have. Twitter is not saying all celebrities lie, just that most of them have told a lie or two. Check out some of the lies Twitter says our celebs have told. http://twitter.com/Ayoza_/status/805056222378528768 http://twitter.com/AshleyLesufi/status/805056738819002368 none of them was raised by both parents they went through some struggle none of them had a normal childhood #LiesCelebritiesTell &mdash; mO_mOdise Moremi (@_RealMRmO) December 3, 2016 Growing up was never easy, had to work part time to help put the foods on the table #LiesCelebritiesTell &mdash; Lourens Shoatja (@LourensShoatja) December 3, 2016 http://twitter.com/JustKholii_/status/805067676582379521 When I came to Johannesburg I had R50 on my pocket, but look at me now I&#39;m making millions&#8230; Qhatha ban. #LiesCelebritiesTell &mdash; Zakhe (@BeeSiya) December 3, 2016 http://twitter.com/Sthee_Gee/status/805080578047483904 I don&#39;t see myself as a celebrity.
