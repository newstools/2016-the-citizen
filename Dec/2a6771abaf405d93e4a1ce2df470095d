Police attached to the Mitchells Plain policing cluster, together with the Asset Forfeiture Unit (AFU) and the director of public prosecutions (DPP), have swooped on various premises owned by a well-known self-proclaimed gang leader in Cape Town, Western Cape police said on Saturday. This was done [on Friday] in order for the curator to seize assets to the value of R1.7 million, Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said. Assets, including luxury motor vehicles, a trailer, a superbike, and vehicles of a business linked to the suspect, were seized at his premises in Lentegeur, Mitchells Plain; Athlone Industrial; Reindeer Street, Grassy Park; and in Worcester. During September 2015 police confiscated a large quantity of drugs and cash at a house in Grassy Park. Police together with the office of the AFU seized the drugs and money amounting to more than R4 million. The investigation continues and the suspects arrested, including the said well-known self-proclaimed gang leader, are due to appear in the Khayelitsha Priority Court on 24 January 2017 on 239 charges, which include dealing in drugs, money laundering, and other charges in terms of POCA [Prevention of Organised Crime Act], which charges relate to racketeering, Rwexana said.
