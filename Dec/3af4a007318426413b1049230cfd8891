You could be excused for thinking that the decision by influential American ratings agency Standard and Poor s to hold off awarding this country junk investment status is a cause for celebration. Quite simply, it is not. The bitter truth of it all is that investors worldwide gauge their decisions on what the analysts at S&amp;P perceive, and it is all about the prevailing financial logic of laying out money to make a return. This country slipped from BBB+ status to BBB at the weekend, just one step ahead from the hugely expensive business of buying credit at inflated levels, and the very strong possibility of overseas investors selling up in South Africa and heading for the distant hills. The government and the ratings agencies have all commented on this aspect of the fractured prism which defines our citizens in their political, social and ethical context. But there is a wider responsibility to the country than the narrow focus being applied. We all have to reach the somewhat deflating realisation that in the greater scheme of things, South Africa remains an insignificant country on the southern tip of a continent, which the world regards with some trepidation. And that, while investment returns might have historically been attractive, we still do not generate a gross national product big enough to seriously challenge the state of Texas. We are just another item on the crowded agenda of a ratings agency meeting. We have to give kudos to the finance minister and Treasury officials for fighting so hard to keep our head above the junk status morass. But we all have to understand that the real battle to save our stagnant economy starts now. The sense of entitlement by the elite must stop. Such enrichment, which is unearned and often unwarranted, always comes at the expense of the poor.
