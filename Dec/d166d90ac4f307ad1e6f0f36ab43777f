Cricket players will need to be careful in future what they say and how they say it &#8211; they might just be red-carded. The MCC, who are tasked with upholding and changing the laws of the game, on Wednesday announced they will receive a recommendation from their world cricket committee to implement such a penalty. Headed by former England captain Mike Brearley, the committee believes discipline at all levels of the game have tanked to such an extent that action is needed. &#8220;The World Cricket committee believes that the game must now include a mechanism to deal with the worst disciplinary offences during the match,&#8221; the MCC said a statement. A red card would specifically apply in cases of a player threatening an umpire, physically assaulting another player, umpire, official or spectator, or any other act of violence on the field of play . Yet the committee members were also quick to state that these punishments are aimed at recreational cricket &#8211; club cricket &#8211; rather than the professionals. In England specifically, the local umpiring body noted that the amount of abuse its umpires are getting has started to take its toll. &#8220;A recent survey by Portsmouth University showed that 40% of British umpires said that episodes of abuse made them question whether or not to continue umpiring, said the MCC. Lesser sanctions such as a sin-bin (or yellow card) and run penalties have also been proposed. If approved, these new laws will be applied as early as October 2017.
