A police officer held a dog in his last moments of his life after he was poisoned, reports the Pretoria Moot Rekord. Meanwhile, two security guards recovered a vehicle that was stolen by the suspects who had poisoned the dog. Derick Goosen, a Pretoria resident, praised the &#8220;heroes&#8221; who stood by him this week. Goosen said on Wednesday morning he was awakened by an employee at his home. &#8220;My Nissan 1400 was stolen. The gardener came to wake me up minutes after the thieves with my truck had disappeared,&#8221; said Goosen. &#8220;I called Moot police and spoke with Warrant Officer George McDonald.&#8221; Goosen said: &#8220;I briefly described my car, and he acted like lightning and reported the theft on the radio.&#8221; Kilnerpark Security (KPS) was quick to respond to the emergency call. &#8220;One of their response vehicles chased the suspects in my truck. Near the Jacaranda Children&#8217;s Home, they [the thieves] left my truck, &#8220;said Goosen. &#8220;I am still amazed at how quickly they [the security officers] found the truck. Within 13 minutes of my truck stolen, they recovered it. &#8221; Goosen said as he waited for news of his vehicle, he realised with shock that his dog had been poisoned. &#8220;It was still dark and I could not see. I just felt my dog leaned against me. &#8221; Goosen said his three-year-old boerbull ridgeback crossing, Noah, acted strangely. &#8220;When I got my flashlight and shined it on him, I saw the foam in its mouth. I knew he was poisoned. &#8221; Goosen said Moot police then arrived at his home. &#8220;Sergeant William Lesolang helped me, especially with Noah,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He (Lesolang) had not even taken off his jacket and held my dog, who kept vomiting and drooling, in his arms.&#8221; Goosen said he recognised the pieces in the polony that the dog vomited up as being Two-Step poison. Goosen&#8217;s voice cracked as he talked about Noah. He had only adopted the dog a few months ago. &#8220;He was such a strong dog. There was enough poison in the pieces that they gave him to kill 10 dogs. Yet Noah kept on fighting. &#8221; Goosen said sadly his dog eventually lost the battle. &#8220;I&#8217;m so grateful for the Moot police officers and Claremont Police Station who assisted and supported me at my house. &#8220;They even offered to help bury Noah.&#8221; Goosen said the KPS security guards who traced his car went the &#8220;extra mile&#8221; to help him. &#8220;Especially I want to thank McDonald, Lesolang and Constables Mphahu Herman Mahlwele Richard Rakolote and Danie Rautenbach. All of them are heroes and I will be eternally grateful for the selfless service rendered by them. &#8221; Caxton News Service More news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
