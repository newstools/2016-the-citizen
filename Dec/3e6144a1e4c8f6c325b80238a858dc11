Close to 200 drivers were arrested since the start of the festive season for drunk driving, the Western Cape Transport and Public Works Department said on Thursday. A total of 181 people have spent time behind bars after being found to be over the legal limit, the department said in a statement. The most DUI [driving under the influence] arrests were recorded in the Caledon service area (26), followed by Somerset West (23), Mossel Bay (22) and George (21). This despite repeated warnings by traffic authorities that alcohol and roads don t mix. The department urged motorists to act responsibly and not drive after heavy drinking as New Year s celebrations approach. Pedestrians, who are often extremely drunk and walking on freeways and busy roads on weekend nights, are also reminded to heed to this call. The department said traffic officers would remain out in full force to ensure booze-free roads . Our traffic officers have shown that they will not hesitate to test drivers who are suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol, and arrest them if necessary. Drivers under the influence put their own lives and those of their passengers in danger, as well as the lives of other road users. If you re drinking, don t drive or walk.
