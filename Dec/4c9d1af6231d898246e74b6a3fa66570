Eskom announced on Friday that Golden Gardens suburb in the Vaal, in Gauteng, finally had electricity. Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe said: As part of ensuring that previously disadvantaged households are connected in line with government s aspirations, Eskom s electrification drive has reached another milestone with the switch-on of the Golden Gardens, a suburb along the Golden Highway in the Vaal in the Gauteng province.

A total of 320 households, already connected to the electricity network, were switched on for the first time in that area, bringing South Africa s goal of universal access to electricity a step closer to reality. The Vaal is part of government s human settlement project aimed at providing housing and restoring the dignity to the previously disadvantaged and less-affording South Africans. As an agent of government, Eskom is central in the restoration of dignity of the poor beneficiaries, as the impact of electricity significantly improves the quality of their lives, said Phasiwe.
