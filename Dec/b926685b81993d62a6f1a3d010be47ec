Parliament s ad hoc committee looking into the affairs of the embattled South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) on Friday confirmed the Speaker of the National Assembly had issued instructions for a summons to be served on the broadcaster s chairman after he failed to appear before MPs. Mbulaheni Maguvhe led a walkout on the first day of the inquiry on Wednesday morning after the committee rejected several attempts by him to suspend the inquiry. On Thursday, he failed to appear before the committee to testify at its inquiry. The Ad Hoc Committee on South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) Board Inquiry can confirm that the Speaker of the National Assembly has duly instructed the Secretary to Parliament to summon the Chairperson of the SABC Board to attend the inquiry and deliver the requested documents, a statement said.

Maguvhe was also required to deliver documents for which he had already received a summons to hand over to committee. The SABC is refusing to hand over 10 of 15 documents requested by the committee. The outstanding documents include seven which the broadcaster felt was commercially sensitive and another three which was no longer in its possession. Maguvhe will now have to present himself before the inquiry to testify on Tuesday. If he fails to do so, MP may use the law to charge him with being in contempt of Parliament.
