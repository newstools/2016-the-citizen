The feud between Babes Wodumo and the Buyel Ekhaya Pan African Music Festival organisers has resulted in them revealing how much she charged them for a performance that fans were not impressed with. After allegedly arriving late for her performance last week, further refusing to perform, Babes had allegedly been paid a deposit of 75%, which was R75 000. This means the Wololo hit maker charges R100K for a performance. The amount she charges landed her on the trends list on Twitter, with most saying they did not understand why she charged that much &#8220;just to go on stage and lipsync to Wololo&#8221;. Some, however, said the amount was worth it, slamming South Africans for &#8220;thinking our local talent comes cheap&#8221;. If newcomer Babes charged R100K, how much did DJ Black Coffee charge for a gig, some asked.
