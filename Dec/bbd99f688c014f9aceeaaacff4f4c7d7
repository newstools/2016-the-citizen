Former Cosatu general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi has taken to social media to air his views on the state of the country&#8217;s quality of education. This after the Independent Examinations Board (IEB) boasted a matric pass rate of 98.67% this year, up from the 98.30% in 2015. Out of the 98.67% who passed in private schools, 87.61% are eligible to go on to study for a degree, and 9.83% qualified for entry to diploma study, compared with 11.66% in 2015. Vavi says &#8220;this is the source and face of deepening inequalities&#8221;, adding that this is because the rich can buy better education. &#8220;The rich and upper middle class can afford to buy better education, security, health care whilst the poor contend with inferior services,&#8221; Vavi said. The rich and upper middle class can afford to buy better education, security, health care whilst the poor contend with inferior services &mdash; Zwelinzima Vavi (@Zwelinzima1) December 29, 2016 He further identified apartheid and imperialism as the &#8220;prime sources&#8221; of inequalities. He blamed the ANC for allegedly failing to implement what they promised in 1994 and 2009 when it came to education. &#8220;Can somebody do what @MYANC promised to do in 1994 and again in 2009? That&#8217;s the only solution &#8211; education, education. &#8220;Imperialism/ apartheid prime sources of inequalities &amp; most evils but one of those top evils is education &amp; inaction. &#8220;We need to retrain our educators but also to get a buy in on the new culture of learning and teaching,&#8221; he added. Vavi was met with lots of criticism from his Twitter followers. Tieho Mokhatla @tiehomokhatla asked Vavi &#8220;who is providing the inferior service?&#8221;, indirectly saying that government was to blame for the &#8220;inferior&#8221; education. Islolly @islolly responded to Vavi, saying: &#8220;They work their butts off for it, often making untold of sacrifices to fund the schooling, medical aids etc&#8221;, to a response by Maggs Naidu, asking: &#8220;@islolly erm, uhm &#8230; do all people who work their butts off wealthy??? Differently is poverty a consequence of laziness???&#8221;. AntiEtolls Activist @moregish &#8220;@islolly @maggsnaidu so true, struggling middle class sacrifice everything to see their kids get quality education from private schools&#8221;.
