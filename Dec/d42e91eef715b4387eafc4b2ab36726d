The Springboks have been so poor in 2016, even the New Zealand media are suddenly interested in our rugby politics. Following last weekend&#8217;s unexpectedly big reforms announced by the South African Rugby Union (Saru), the New Zealand Herald &#8211; the country&#8217;s biggest daily newspaper &#8211; on Tuesday was so surprised, it chose to publish a whole article on the matter. Also read: Four reasons why Allister Coetzee (probably) won&#8217;t be fired Headlined &#8220;Springboks horror seasons sparks South African rugby shake-up&#8221;, the piece describes Saru&#8217;s decisions as a &#8220;move that can be compared to turkeys voting for Christmas&#8221;. &#8220;The changes to South African rugby&#8217;s outdated model were accelerated by the dire performance of the Springboks, who lost eight out of 12 Tests,&#8221; the publication wrote. &#8220;SA Rugby chief executive Jurie Roux had the job of selling the changes to the provincial union representatives, who have been criticised for years for voting in the interests of their own local unions and teams at the expense of South African rugby as a whole.&#8221; Of course the Herald jazzed up Roux&#8217;s quotes from a press release, attributing the turkey statement to him when he actually never said it. Allister Coetzee, the embattled Bok coach, will have his performance review conducted later on Tuesday. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
