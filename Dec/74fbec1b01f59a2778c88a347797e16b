The battle lines have been drawn between the controversial Gupta family and the Economic Freedom Fighters. This follows the issuing of a warrant for the family to seize property worth approximately R180 000 from the EFF s headquarters in Braamfontein for auction. According to News24, an execution order was granted by the North Gauteng Court in Pretoria to the Guptas, and some of their companies, and instructs the sheriff to seize property from the party s office to cover the Gupta family s legal costs following a court battle between the two. Earlier this year, the Guptas took the EFF and its leader Julius Malema to court over threats made against the family.

Furthermore, the party was ordered to pay the Guptas legal costs, which came close to R140 000. The EFF tried to unsuccessfully appeal the ruling and in the end, had to pay the Guptas an additional R38 000. Godrich Gardee, the EFF general secretary denied the party had received a bill from the Guptas or the execution order. He also questioned whether the order had been served to the party directly or through the media. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
