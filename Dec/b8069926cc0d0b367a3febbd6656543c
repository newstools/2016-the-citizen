KwaZulu-Natal health MEC Sibongiseni Dhlomo has condemned an incident in which two health workers were assaulted and government property damaged by people accompanying a patient at KwaDukuza Clinic in Stanger on Wednesday. It is alleged that the group of rowdy and possibly drunk people had brought in their injured colleague when they got involved in an argument with clinical staff members. It is believed that the group had been attending a Christmas year-end party where alcohol was served, the KwaZulu-Natal health department said in a statement. As the argument escalated, the group began attacking the health worker as well as his colleague. They were joined by more revellers from the party. Clinic security tried to intervene but were outnumbered by the attackers. Fortunately, other security officers who had been passing by stopped and also got involved in trying to defuse the situation. They were also joined by SAPS [South African Police Service] members who arrested some of the alleged attackers. Two health workers sustained injuries, with one having to receive medical attention. The clinic s main gate was damaged and ripped off the rails by the attackers. Repairs to the gate were currently underway to ensure the safety of staff since the facility provided a 24-hour service. We are alarmed and, quite frankly, disgusted by this incident. We will not tolerate any form of behaviour that threatens the safety and wellbeing of health professionals and health facility support staff who render such important work, Dhlomo said. In fact, the life-saving work that these people do is sacrosanct and should never be interfered with by anybody. We therefore call upon society to help protect our staff at all times. We also wish to express our gratitude to the security guards and SAPS for their intervention in this incident, he said. African News Agency (ANA)
