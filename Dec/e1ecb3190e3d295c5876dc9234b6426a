Discovery Holdings on Thursday said it was still searching for a suitable candidate to replace its outgoing chief financial officer and group financial director, Richard Farber, who was due to leave on December 31st. Farber announced in June that he would be stepping down to relocate to Australia. He remained as a director on the board while the process to appoint his replacement got underway. The process to identify a replacement for Mr Farber has not been completed and the company hopes to announce an appointment early in 2017, Discovery said. Mr Farber will continue in the role of CFO and Group Financial Director, through this appointment and the subsequent handover. Farber, a chartered accountant, has been the financial director of Discovery since 2009 and served as chief financial officer of Discovery Group since 2003. African News Agency (ANA)
