He was abandoned by his mother at two weeks old and went on to be raised by different family members. &nbsp; As a child I never had toys,A relative who raised me did her best to feed me but I couldn&#8217;t get a chance to go to school. When ever she looks at me now, she always says &#8220;Khehla,we did not know what were you talking about if you say, one day you will sing on TV and cassettes and bless people with your voice&#8221;. My aim was to bless people and change people&#8217;s lives through my ministry, I never thought an uneducated boy like me who can&#8217;t even speak English well will also get such recognitions . It&#8217;s only the Grace and the mercy of God. If God remembered me, your time is also coming. Bekezela.kuzolunga.

He shared it three days ago. It reads: &#8220;Be quiet and give me a chance to speak, and let the results be what they will.&#8221; &#8220;I am ready to risk my life. I&#8217;ve lost all hope, so what if God kills me? I am going to state my case to him. It may even be that my boldness will save me, since no wicked person would dare to face God,&#8221; more verses read after the initial one. &nbsp; Be quiet and give me a chance to speak, and let the results be what they will.
