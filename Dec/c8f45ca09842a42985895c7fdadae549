Drivers and learners licence tests will soon be offered on the same premises at the Rayton licensing offices in Tshwane, as renovations and refurbishment will start in January. The renovations will see the closure of the Rayton licensing office for four months, from January 3, City of Tshwane spokesperson Lindela Mashigo said. The only service would be the collection of driver s licence cards, which will be allowed to run to its natural exhaustion, he said. This refurbishment is necessary as the administrative tasks related to learner and driving licence testing are performed at the main municipal building, which is away from the testing centre. This makes the management and control of these sensitive processes problematic, Mashigo said.

The public are advised to visit the Bronkhorstspruit, Waltloo or any other driving licence testing centre of their choice. Upon the completion of the renovations and integration of the new technology system, a date to resume services offered by the Rayton licensing office will be communicated to the public.
