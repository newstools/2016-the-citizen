Investigations are under way after an uMhlanga business on Aurora Drive in Durban was targeted by three men in a robbery. Durban North police spokesperson Captain Raymond Deokaran confirmed the incident, which occurred at about 6.40pm on Monday, Northglen News reported. The men entered the store and demanded the employees hand over their cash and valuables. The men did not produce firearms but threatened the people in the store. &#8220;They made off with two cellphones as well as cash to the value of R34 000. No arrests have been made, and no one was harmed in the incident, he said. He added it was unclear if the suspects were linked to the robbery of a store on Equinox Drive last week, where more than R800 000 worth of equipment was stolen. A video showing the shocking robbery was posted by the owner with a reward of R100 000. &#8211; Caxton News Service For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
