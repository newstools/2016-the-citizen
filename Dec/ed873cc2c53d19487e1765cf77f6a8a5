South African authorities have confined the former first vice-president and leader of the rebel Sudan People s Liberation Movement-In Opposition (SPLM-IO), Riek Machar, to a residence outside Pretoria in order to prevent him from leaving the country again. Machar arrived in South Africa on November 21 without Pretoria s knowledge after fleeing Juba, claiming President Salva Kiir wanted to assassinate him. According to Reuters, Machar was being held basically under house arrest near Pretoria, with his movements restricted and his phone calls monitored and controlled. If he wants to go to the toilet, he has to hand over his phone, and a guy stands outside the cubicle, a well-informed source stressed. However, South African foreign ministry spokesperson Clayson Monyela denied that Machar was being held, adding he was a guest of Pretoria to prevent the civil war sliding into genocide, the Sudan Tribune reported on Wednesday. Him being our guest here is part of our responsibility as a mediator, Monyela told Reuters, adding that it was difficult to predict the duration of his stay. It s very hard to put timelines on these peace and security situations.
