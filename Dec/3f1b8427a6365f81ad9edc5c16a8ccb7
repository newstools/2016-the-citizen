Gauteng health workers were paid late due to a severe cash crunch, the Democratic Alliance said on Tuesday. I have established that thousands of Gauteng Community Health Workers have not yet been paid their R2500 stipend for November because the Gauteng Health Department is facing a severe cash crunch, DA Gauteng Shadow MEC for Health, Jack Bloom said. The CHWs are paid by the SmartPurse company which receives funds from the department to pay them every month. Bloom said some CHWs have been told they would be paid on December 6, others on December 8 and some on December 13. He said CHWs have been treated appallingly by the department despite their valuable role in doing home visits and combating HIV/Aids and TB. Bloom alleges that in May, SmartPurse was contracted to pay 9000 CHWs, but many did not sign up and those who did complained of poor administration and late payments. I have been told of one CHW who committed suicide after killing his girlfriend, who left him because he wasn t getting paid. It is outrageous that the department inflicts suffering on its lowest paid workers instead of ring-fencing the money to pay them, said Bloom. Bloom said the Gauteng Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu needs to explain the department s poor financial management and why CHWs are so poorly treated. SmartPurse and the department could not be reached for comment. African News Agency For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter. &nbsp;
