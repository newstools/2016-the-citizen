Reports about state capture, even those advanced by the office of the public protector under Thuli Madonsela s tenure are serious enough to give all South Africans a grave case for concern but allegations which have surfaced over state manipulation are downright dangerous. Police Minister Nathi Nhleko has reportedly been named in a civil case involving the alleged use of intelligence resources to establish a rival trade union to the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu). If these allegations prove to have any credence, the rise of Amcu on the violence-scarred platinum belt in North West gave rise to President Jacob Zuma becoming directly involved. Amcu has had much to do with the reported exodus of workers from of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and the internecine friction within the financially-vital mining industry and the tensions within trade union federation Cosatu and the tripartite alliance. NUM boasted 300 000 members at its zenith though estimates now put the union s following at half that number and was a formidable voice with both industry and government, having been under the stewardship of current Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa. The allegations against the police minister stem from one of the founders of the Workers Association Union (WAU), Thebe Maswabi, who is understood to be suing President Jacob Zuma, State Security Minister David Mahlobo and other defendants for R120 million. Maswabi contends that agents of the State Security Agency, he maintains on Zuma s instruction, had provided him with money and vehicles to establish WAU, but that the payments later stopped, leaving him in debt. This allegation still has to be proven. But it does lead to the parallel thoughts that nothing is simple in the South African political arena and very little tends to astound citizens any more.
