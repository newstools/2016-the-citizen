Despite stories doing the rounds, especially on social media, Ekurhuleni has not relaxed water restrictions, metro spokesperson Themba Gadebe said on Thursday, reports the Kempton Express. On the contrary, Ekurhuleni is one of the municipalities that has yet to reach the required 15% water saving as imposed by national government. Water savings are monitored on a weekly basis and since the implementation of the restrictions, it has yet to reach the targeted 15%,&#8221; Gadebe said. At a meeting with the Department of Water and Sanitation, Rand Water and municipalities on December 7, Ekurhuleni recorded an 8% saving, with neighbouring metropolitan municipalities Joburg at 10.5% and Tshwane at 19.5% for the week. Ekurhuleni has implemented water rationing from 9pm to 5am in all areas according to a roster. Various engagements have been held with the business sector and industrial areas in Ekurhuleni are responding well to the call of saving water. Gadebe said the restrictions would only be relooked in May 2017. Restrictions that apply: Low pressure to curb water use across the region. Use of hosepipe and sprinkler system is prohibited. No filling of swimming pool with municipal water. No watering from 6am to 6pm. Thereafter only with a watering can/bucket. 25kl monthly consumption limit on households. If this is exceeded, a 10% fine is imposed. Should the above not be adhered to, including illegal water connections (egg using fire hydrants), a fine of R6 753.64 will be imposed on households per incident. For business, this fine is R13 762.24. Any incidents can be reported to the City via email.
