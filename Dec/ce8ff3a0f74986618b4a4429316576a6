In the aftermath of the Blitzboks&#8217; heartbreaking 17-19 loss to England in the final of the weekend&#8217;s Cape Town Sevens, Seabelo Senatla chose to make a startling admission. The 23-year-old try-machine &#8211; named World Sevens Player of the Year last month &#8211; revealed it was him and not the coaching staff who decided he shouldn&#8217;t play in the showpiece game after he sustained a calf injury earlier in the day. And it clearly affected the Blitzboks, as they lacked some killer instinct.

I couldn&#8217;t get my movement right, but I decided to take the risk for the semifinal anyway. I know how much value it adds to the rest of the guys just seeing me on the field. They get a little bit of confidence with me being around them, and I did it for that.&#8221; But Senatla had to be withdrawn at half-time and, after seeing how well South Africa coped without him against New Zealand, felt he should rather sit out the final. &#8220;After warming up, I still didn&#8217;t feel right. I felt I would let the guys down if I went in there 70% in a final when there was a guy fully fit on the sidelines. It took a decision in the interest of my team. That is our culture,&#8221; he said.
