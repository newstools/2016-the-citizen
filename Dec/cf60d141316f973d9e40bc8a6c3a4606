MoralitySeveral artistes during the year tasted the Arts Councils wrath after they were found in breach of the law.Nay wa Mitego s controversial song Shika Adabu Yako and Pale Kati rubbed the mighty on the wrong side and the songs were consequently banned. Snura s original Chura too didn t see the light of day after it was deemed too raunchy as it displayed erotic content and therefore compromising the nation s moral values.Ambwene Yesaya s Zigo Remix, too was a subject of moral concern, the authorities claimed it could not be aired during primetime. MoviesWhereas the music scenery was super busy, the movie sector was, on the other hand, rather silent.Salim Ahmed, famously known as Gado, who starred in Safari ya Gwalu, was considerably the solo vocal figure in the sector as he scooped awards in the EATV and ZIFF awards.Other prominent film makers such as Salum Stika, Godliver Gordian, Chuchu Hans and Amil Shivji endured the competition from Rwanda and Kenya, who dominated the film industry in East Africa during 2016.
