The case against former Hawks head Anwa Dramat and his two accused was postponed in the Pretoria Magistrate s Court on Friday after the police minister yet again failed to respond to a request for financial aid. Dramat s two co-accused, Major-General Shadrack Sibiya and Colonel Lesley Maluleke, turned to the minister after their first application for financial aid was dismissed by current Hawks head Lieutenant-General Berning Ntlemeza. So far only Dramat s request for financial aid has been approved. The men are facing charges of organised crime, kidnapping, violations of the Immigration Act and obstruction of justice, following the extradition of Zimbabweans. All three are out on R5 000 bail. They state that during the alleged crimes and execution of their duties they were acting on behalf of the police minister. They argued the alleged crimes were committed during the course of their official duties. These two former senior officials of the Hawks are now approaching the North Gauteng High Court and they are hopeful that their case will be heard in the first quarter of 2017. Dramat told The Citizen that he had flown in from Cape Town for today s court appearance and that he was tired. The case was postponed to March 3 next year.
