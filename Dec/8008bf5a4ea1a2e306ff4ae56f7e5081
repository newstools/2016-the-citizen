Mark Warona Zinde, 23, accused of killing his television personality mother and former SABC board member Hope Zinde, 50, is expected to again appear in the Brits Magistrate s Court in North West on Monday. ALSO READ: Zinde s son &#8216;attacks&#8217; his father report The prosecution is expected to apply for his bail to be revoked following his arrest in Gauteng on another charge. He was arrested in November for allegedly attacking his father Dr Lebohang Manoto at his Walkerville home, south of Johannesburg. Manoto, who took him in after he was released on R10 000 bail, laid charges of assault against his son. The State alleges Zinde killed his mother at their home in Pecanwood Estate at Hartbeespoort Dam near Brits in June. He faces charges of murder and possession of drugs. ALSO READ: Mark Zinde back in court for mother Hope s murder During his bail application in September, prosecutor Hanna Conradie argued that Zinde was a danger to society and should not be granted bail. She said a psychiatrist could visit him while he was in custody. This was after Francois Joubert, for Zinde, argued that he was a suitable candidate and it was in the interests of justice that he be granted bail so that he would be able to appoint a psychiatrist to evaluate his metal state. The defence is opposing the psychiatric report from Weskoppies Psychiatric Hospital which found that Zinde was fit to stand trial.
