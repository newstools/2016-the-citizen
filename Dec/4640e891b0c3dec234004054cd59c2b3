If there is a Twitter account that is effective in dealing with customer complaints and being savage, it has to be the City of Joburg. We can only tell from the initials that it is operated by different staff members, however, one of them, TK, is the most savage of all. They know how to throw the right amount of shade, lately making fun of Babes Wodumo&#8217;s most recent scandal at the Buyel&#8217;Ekhaya festival last week.

It did not work out for them, as they were only told to go back to the &#8217;80s alone.
