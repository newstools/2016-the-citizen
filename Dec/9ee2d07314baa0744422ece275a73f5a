It is a time of year that every manager in the English Premier League has come to dread &#8230; the logjam of league fixtures which hardly leaves a spare day to unwrap the Christmas presents or gobble down a hasty portion of roast turkey. There is just no let-up for the clubs or their players. Not even for a team such as Chelsea, who go into this weekend against Crystal Palace a dominant six points ahead on the log. For managers like former Italian national side supremo Antonio Conte of Chelsea and more especially among the rest chasing league honours or trying to stave off relegation there is the constant worry that a crucial suspension or a couple of key injuries will leave a monster dent in the club s aspirations. Injury is a constant threat in the tangle of fixtures and the weather, ranging from inclement to perversely foul. It is also self-evident that the worse the conditions, the more severe those injuries are likely to get. It continues to remain one of those British aberrations the Scottish League is equally complicit that while the rest of the European leagues, including the pragmatic Germans, take a sensible break to recharge the batteries and duck the sleet, they continue to play on at an increased tempo. Tradition is one thing, but it must surely take a back seat in the age of multimillion-pound footballers who rate not so much as the artisans of old, but as highly valuable assets. Financially, the arrangement must make sense to the accountants: live football when there is virtually no other game in town. The fans, despite the discomfort, pour into the grounds and the television money from the most-viewed league in the world stacks up, like Santa s hampers. Only the Brits, you must surely ponder, could have invented a game their climate is patently unsuited for. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
