Two rising stars from the Knights on Monday gave the touring Sri Lankans unexpected resistance in Potchefstroom. Matches featuring the South African Invitational XI are usually quite dull and meaningless but for once that wasn&#8217;t quite the case. The hosts&#8217; respectable 285/8 at the end of the second day of this three-day outing was down to 21-year-old Leus du Plooy.

Interestingly for a man of his undoubted talent, Du Plooy was overlooked for the national Under-19 side yet immediately made an impression when he made his first-class debut last year, scoring an unbeaten 107 in a semi-pro provincial game for Free State. After a successful stint in the off-season with the South African Emerging side &#8211; he scored two centuries in a triangular one-day tournament &#8211; Du Plooy gradually played himself into Nic Boje&#8217;s Knights side. He impressed in the recently concluded domestic T20 competition, particularly when he hit an attractive 45 off 33 against the Highveld Lions in Kimberley. Du Plooy received marginal support from his team-mates as the Invitational XI&#8217;s second highest score was the pair of 25s scored by Khaya Zondo and George Linde. On a pitch that Shukri Conrad, the hosts&#8217; coach, admits is heavily in favour of the batters, the Sri Lankan attack struggled to make an impression. There was some encouragement for Angelo Mathews, the visitors&#8217; captain, who delivered a good spell of 2/15 from seven overs. He&#8217;ll hope to score some runs on Tuesday after failing in the first innings. Earlier, Duanne Olivier helped mop up Sri Lanka&#8217;s tail as they made 373 after being 328/6 overnight. The 24-year-old fast bolwer from the central franchise showcased all his strengths in an excellent performance. He finished with 4/54, combining wicket-taking ability with a good economy rate. It&#8217;s an ideal combination for any fast bowler. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
