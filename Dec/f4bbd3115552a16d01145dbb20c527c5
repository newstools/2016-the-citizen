This year may have started on a bad note, and perhaps ended on one with a truckload of celeb deaths. However, the music industry made it possible for us all to dance despite everything. DJ Monada&#8217;s Ska Bhora Moreki is one hit song that makes fans stop doing whatever they were doing for a bit of fun. The line has also been used on politicians, such as DA&#8217;s Helen Zille and EFF CIC Julius Malema after they were &#8220;bothering&#8221; followers with their advice on spending habits. This white motorist, who seemed to have been on a long trip with his family, needed something to keep him awake, so he played the hit song. In a video circulating on Instagram, the man sings along with it, while a young boy at the back is trying to dance.
