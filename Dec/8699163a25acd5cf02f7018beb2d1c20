It was a classic case of boys against men as the Blitzboks waltzed into the final of the Dubai Sevens after comfortably beating a youthful Wales side 36-5 in a one-sided semifinal. The gulf in experience was apparent as South Africa merely preyed on their opponents&#8217; capriciousness, who truly were their own worst enemies. Four of the Blitzboks&#8217; six tries were on the counter as the Dragons, who boasted numerous promising u-20 players in their squad, simply couldn&#8217;t cope with their opponent&#8217;s relentless counter-rucking. It was a feature of their splendid 40-0 triumph over the All Blacks earlier in the day. Seabelo Senatla was the biggest beneficiary as he cantered to a first-half hat-trick. All three times South Africa turned over possession and exploited the blindside, where Senatla was left unmarked. The Blitzboks&#8217; were also superb on defence again, pointing to their versatility and suggesting they are the side best equipped to stop Fiji, who will be their opponents in the showpiece after beating England 31-12. Kick-off is at 17:33. Point-scorers: Blitzboks (19) &#8211; Tries: Seabelo Senatla (3), Justin Geduld (2), Werner Kok. Conversions: Branco du Preez (2), Cecil Afrika. Wales 5 (0) &#8211; Try: Ethan Davies.
