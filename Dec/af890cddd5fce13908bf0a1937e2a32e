The prevailing feeling following the failure of the ANC national executive council to take any decisive decisions is that the more the volatile pressures pile up on our absentee president, Jacob Zuma, the more shaky the status quo remains. Any expected fireworks on a call for a vote of no confidence in Zuma in Cuba for the funeral of revolutionary leader Fidel Castro which was launched within the executive council s hastily extended indaba in Pretoria, were effectively rendered a damp squib, doused in the droning guttural growl of ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe s delivery. There would be no ousting of Zuma as leader of the state and the party. Neither, he intimated, would there be gore by the gallon left on the Union Building carpets in a rapid ministerial bloodletting aimed at those who have risen like a sudden tsunami to oppose the beleaguered president. You can rely on one thing, though. Zuma s retribution might not be swift but it is certain in the period he clings precariously to power as the echelons of his erstwhile backers split from the strict forced march to the ANC s tightly disciplined drum. In this regard, the party must perforce change and there is hope that a new, freer-thinking order may yet still emerge to mend the turmoil of divisions within and reaffirm a sense of democratically working its way through the morass of self-serving nepotism and corruption, which continues to block our advance as a nation. It is also advantageous, in the long term, that the realisation is starting to grow that what the ANC says in public is not writ in stone, but often rash scratchings in the sands of expediency. If we are to grow as a nation, this growth must be mirrored in a blossoming of introspection within the ANC. If it does not, the outlook is bleak indeed.
