Sport and Recreation Minister Fikile Mbalula is under fire from opposition MPs in the National Assembly after he missed his question-and-answer session in the House for the second time in a row. ALSO READ: I witnessed hatred in the NEC &#8211; Mantashe A statement released by the Democratic Alliance (DA) on Wednesday indicated that Mbalula was abroad, meeting with Spanish soccer team Barcelona, instead of coming to the national legislature to account on his performance as sports minister. Ministers in the social cluster were scheduled to give oral replies to MPs&#8217; questions, but some failed to pitch up, instead sending their deputies. This is now the second consecutive session of oral questions in the House that Minister Mbalula has been absent for. The Constitution is very clear that ministers are accountable collectively and individually to Parliament, said DA chief whip John Steenhuisen. Steenhuisen said at the chief whips&#8217; forum earlier on Wednesday it was unclear whether Mbalula would be at the sitting. He also said Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, as the leader of government business in the National Assembly, had given assurances that MPs would see an improvement in accountability from Cabinet ministers. We have not seen an improvement &#8230; In a year, a minister must come at least three times. To miss two in a row is disrespectful to this House, Steenhuisen said. Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) chief whip Floyd Shivambu said Mbalula had travelled for things that have no relationship with sports development. He&#8217;s apparently in Spain now. For what, we do not know, he said.

Apparently the minister s spokesperson reportedly said Mbalula was not in Spain to take selfies . For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
