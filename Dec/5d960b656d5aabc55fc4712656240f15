Ray Jennings, former Proteas head coach, insists his son, Keaton, won&#8217;t become the new Kevin Pietersen after being called up to the England Test squad on their tour to India. The 24-year-old opener, who plays for Durham in the English County Championship, was the leading run-scorer in this year&#8217;s campaign after amassing a colossal 1 548 runs, a haul that included seven centuries. But his elevation shouldn&#8217;t leave a bitter taste in the mouths of some South African cricket fans. &#8220;Keaton really had no problem with South African cricket,&#8221; said Jennings snr. at the weekend. &#8220;He had an excellent grounding at King Edward School and played for the national u-19 side. He&#8217;s grateful for the influence South Africa&#8217;s youth structures had on his development. But, as a 20-year-old, Keaton realised the opportunity to play senior cricket would come quicker in England. It was nothing personal.&#8221; Given how Pietersen is thrilling local fans with his presence in the domestic T20 competition, where he plays for the Dolphins, there is a sense that the South African cricketing fraternity is becoming more accepting of &#8220;exports&#8221; seeking greener pastures overseas. Yet Jennings isn&#8217;t all that sure. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think people are bitter over Keaton leaving, but I do feel we&#8217;ll always have the unfortunate dichotomy of some players leaving for the right reasons and others doing so because they are bitter. That&#8217;s the name of the game in South African cricket,&#8221; he said. Keaton earlier this week admitted tongue-in-cheek that his inclusion left his dad &#8220;speechless, and that doesn&#8217;t happen very often&#8221;. &#8220;He&#8217;s quite right,&#8221; said Jennings with a chuckle. &#8220;His mother is English, which means he has a British passport, but because he played for the national u-19 side, he still had to spend four years in the country to qualify. He&#8217;s a hard-working, intelligent young man and I&#8217;m astounded at how quickly he grabbed the attention of the English selectors.&#8221; However, if Keaton is to make his Test debut in Thursday&#8217;s third Test against India in Mumbai, he certainly won&#8217;t be granted any favours. England are currently 2-0 down in the four-match series and distinctly low on confidence. Has he been included too early perhaps? &#8220;We&#8217;ll never know, unless he actually plays,&#8221; said Jennings. &#8220;There simply isn&#8217;t a more challenging environment for Keaton to introduced to the highest level. He might be overawed or he might flourish. That&#8217;s the interesting thing about his inclusion. I&#8217;m confident either way he&#8217;ll use the experience to grow.&#8221;
