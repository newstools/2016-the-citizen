The lure of the pound has robbed South African cricket of another leading player. English county side Derbyshire on Wednesday confirmed Hardus Viljoen, the strapping fast bowler of the Highveld Lions, has signed a three-year deal starting middle next year. Despite the England and Wales Cricket Board implementing new regulations limiting the amount of so-called &#8220;Kolpak players&#8221; &#8211; South African cricketers that can be considered &#8221; local, home-grown players&#8221; &#8211; a county can sign, Derbyshire intend classify him as such. That means Viljoen, arguably the most consistent and potent quick in domestic cricket for some years, will not be available to play for the Proteas until at least 2019. The 27-year-old had a taste of country cricket earlier this year when he briefly turned out for Kent and did reasonably well, boasting 20 first-class scalps in four matches. &#8220;I&#8217;m very happy and honoured to be joining,&#8221; Viljoen told Derbyshire&#8217;s website. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had a taste of county cricket and thoroughly enjoyed it. Now it will be my main focus and I can&#8217;t wait to charge in on that first game in 2017.&#8221; Also read: Transformation didn&#8217;t force Keaton Jennings&#8217; England switch The county confirmed they had signed Viljoen to be their main strike bowler, just like he has done at the Lions. &#8220;It was clear last summer that we lacked a consistent threat with the ball, and we feel Hardus fits that bill. He s a strike bowler who can bowl over 90 miles-an-hour and has experience both internationally and here in England,&#8221; said Kim Barnett, Derbyshire&#8217;s director of cricket. Viljoen previously revealed he seriously considered moving to New Zealand due to lack of opportunities at national level but decided to stay and was rewarded with a Test debut earlier this year against England. He memorably took captain Alastair Cook&#8217;s wicket with his first ball in international cricket before his lack of control started to count against him &#8211; finishing with unflattering figures of 1/79. However, the emergence of his Lions team-mate Kagiso Rabada and steadiness of Kyle Abbott probably means his opportunities at the Proteas will remain limited. Viljoen is currently second on the wicket-taking charts in the domestic T20 competition with 14 wickets and has bagged 359 in his first-class career.
