Two suspects spent Thursday night behind bars after being arrested on the N2 highway just outside the Mother City for being in possession of copper cables worth half a million rand, Western Cape police said. A member of the Stock Theft Unit, assisted by POP [public order policing] members, followed up on information and busted the duo while they were driving on the N2 towards Cape Town, said police spokesman FC van Wyk. The two were arrested and their truck and the copper cables, valued at approximately R500 000, were confiscated. The duo, aged 35 and 36, were expected to appear in the Athlone Magistrate s Court soon on charges of presumably stolen property . African News Agency (ANA)
