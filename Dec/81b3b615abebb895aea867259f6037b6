Stop focusing just on quotas and start funding our townships. Omphile Ramela, a prominent black player in franchise cricket, certainly strikes a note with this plea to Cricket South Africa (CSA) and government. In an interview with BBC Stories, the Cape Cobras captain says transformation in cricket will not be successful if the relevant role-players continue to neglect the upkeep and improvement of facilities at schools and rural areas. &#8220;It s very difficult to adjust when kids from the townships move to top schools because of the different environment, different language, culture and high fees requirements,&#8221; said Ramela. &#8220;We need to regenerate a new vibe in the township and to give those players the best chance to improve their cricket.&#8221; Also read: Stats show cricket&#8217;s transformation drive isn&#8217;t quite working Ramela also hopes the sport can eventually shake off the perception that the only sport blacks play in the township is soccer. Cricket is actually the second most popular sport in South Africa. &#8220;The idea that black players can t play cricket, or don t want to play cricket is a myth. They just don t have the access and facilities to actually play,&#8221; said Ramela. The sport is indeed a very expensive one as players need to buy a whole range of equipment such as helmets, bats, pads and gloves. It is unaffordable to the average South African household. The left-handed top-order batter, who&#8217;ll lead the South African Invitational XI against the touring Sri Lankans next week, also wants to provide perspective on how its still black players who had the privilege of private schooling that make the national side. &#8220;I was giving a scholarship to St Peter s then St John college and this provided me with good coaching and good mentorship,&#8221; said Ramela. &#8220;That scholarship system has been successful, but the biggest challenge is unlocking the unseen potential in the township and keeping it there.&#8221; Kagiso Rabada, the Proteas&#8217; sensational fast bowler, is the perfect example.

Temba Bavuma also received a scholarship from St David&#8217;s College. CSA is one of the few local federations who have implemented stringent quota requirements at domestic and national levels and Ramela feels that will eventually also bear fruit. &#8220;We&#8217;re starting to get it right,&#8221; said Ramela. &#8220;It was difficult at first but we starting to see the quota system stabilise a bit, but there is still a shortage of black-African players coming through in the domestic and national level.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
