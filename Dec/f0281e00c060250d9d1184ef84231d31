The African National Congress (ANC) on Friday expressed its sadness at the news of the death of Beata Lipman who famously wrote down the original Freedom Charter. Lipman died in Johannensburg at the age of 88 on Thursday. The ANC described Lipman as a revolutionary democrat, accomplished author, film-maker and maker of history . Beata Lipman was known for, amongst her many notable contributions, the scribing in hand of the Freedom Charter South Africa s political lodestar and the ANC s primary programme of action, ANC national spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said in a statement. Together with her husband, Alan Lipman, Comrade Beata Lipman played a key role in the drafting of the Charter, which would later lay a solid foundation for the development of South Africa s Constitution. As we prepare to mark 20 years since the late ANC and South African President, Comrade Nelson Mandela, signed the Constitution into law, we remember with reverence the immeasurable sacrifices made by many, including Comrade Lipman, for us to enjoy the freedoms we do today. With no expectation of recognition or selfish reward, these heroes of our struggle shunned the privileges of their race, and were rather an embodiment of the values to which South Africa continues to aspire a non-racial South Africa united in a common quest to build a society where all her people could live in conditions of equality, liberty and peace. The ANC extended its heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of Lipman, saying: May they be comforted during this time of grief by the knowledge of the indelible mark her hand made to bring us closer to realising the dream of the Congress of the People in 1955.
