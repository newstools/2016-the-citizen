At least one local rugby side has New Zealand&#8217;s number. The Blitzboks did South African rugby proud on Saturday morning by producing a rousing display to thrash the All Blacks by 40-0 in their cup quarterfinal of the Dubai Sevens tournament. Neil Powell&#8217;s charges simply didn&#8217;t give their opponents an inch, especially in the first half. The fact that the All Blacks could only complete five passes in those seven minutes said everything that needed to be said. Cecil Afrika, the Blitzboks&#8217; experienced playmaker, reminded all of his versatility and was definitely the main protagonist in a superb performance. He first sliced through some suspect Kiwi defending before showing off his organisational skills in setting up Seabelo Senatla&#8217;s seventh try of the tournament. From there one, the Blitzboks were simply rampant as they easily managed to shake off the complacency that dogged them on day one, where fluctuating levels of concentration gave undeserving opponents more of a look-in than they deserved. The colourfully dreadlocked Justin Geduld was especially prominent as substitute in showcasing his fleet-footedness, as well as kicking well. South Africa now face Wales in the second semifinal. Kick-off is at 15:03. Point-scorers: Blitzboks 40 (19) &#8211; Tries: Cecil Afrika, Seabelo Senatla, Kyle Brown, Chris Dry, Justin Geduld, Werner Kok. Conversions: Branco du Preez (2), Geduld (2), Afrika.
