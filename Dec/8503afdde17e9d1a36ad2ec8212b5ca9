It&#8217;s that time of the year to reflect on its ups and downs, to see if we&#8217;ve achieved the goals we set in the beginning of the year while also setting new goals for the coming year. The Twitterverse has come up with the #ThingsToBeLeftIn2016, and it is hilarious. Some are just using the hashtag to throw shade at politicians, while some have mentioned things that should not see the light of day in 2017. On a more serious note, Twitter thinks women who turn up with Sassa cards should leave their bad habit in 2016. &#8220;That money belongs to your kids, not you,&#8221; says one Twitter user. &#8220;The abuse of state power to steal from the poor and greedy tendencies,&#8221; should also be left in 2016. Twitter said it did not want any more &#8220;weird&#8221; pastors who use Dettol, Doom and make congregants eat grass. Also, that &#8220;weird&#8221; habit of taking selfies with #FuneralVibes hashtags should be left in 2016 please. How can a funeral be a vibe? These are some of the things Twitter thinks should be left in 2016: #ThingsThatShouldBeLeftIn2016 aboProphet beDoom, beGrass, beDetol etc. &mdash; IG:@iamzii_sokulu (@Iamzii_Sokhulu) December 15, 2016 Being nasty to people for no reason whatsoever.
