It would seem the theme for next year&#8217;s local Super Rugby jerseys is simplicity. The Lions &#8211; like the Sharks earlier this week &#8211; on Thursday night launched their new kit for the 2017 campaign and it&#8217;s definitely not as bold as this season&#8217;s colours. Gone is the interesting black and yellow Joburg cityscape and in comes a more measured white outfit. Also read: LOOK! Sharks reveal their new jerseys for 2017 &#8220;The new jersey is a return to the classic lines and colours that is associated with the Lions Brand, but with new exciting technical innovations it s ideal midway where tradition meets design,&#8221; said Edgar Rathbone, chief financial officer of Lions Rugby Union. &#8220;We feel that the simple design and clear lines really make their (the sponsors) logo s stand out which will see them receive fantastic value in 2017.&#8221; The new jerseys are available in stores from Friday.
