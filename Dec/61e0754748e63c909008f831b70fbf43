The SABC soap opera runs mindlessly on with a script now under attack as lacking ethical depth, but not devoid on any account of the dimension of reported political intrigue and infighting. At the heart of it all looms the figure of Hlaudi Motsoeneng, a character drawn in broad strokes, typified in many quarters as the arch villain of the depressing drama, in others seen in a totally different light though this is admittedly an increasingly narrowing profile. In many ways, Motsoeneng, the former COO at the public broadcaster, presents any number of intriguing enigmas. A relatively obscure producer on Lesedi FM, he literally arrived in the corridors of executive power at the SABC like an unheralded thunderbolt, sweeping away all opposition. That he terrified staff members nominally over him and undoubtedly those subservient to him has been amply testified to in the on-going parliamentary inquiry into the affairs of the public broadcaster. The Western Cape High Court has ruled that his appointment had been illegal, but Motsoeneng, as he has consistently done during his troubled tenure at the corporation s headquarters at Auckland Park in Johannesburg, has now simply walked away from his office and if history is any judge, will again resort to further litigation. Calls for him to be jailed by the opposition DA are almost certainly premature at this stage, but what is not at issue is that Motsoeneng held the SABC in thrall, reportedly spending fortunes in resources to publicise a rival network owned by the Gupta family through business breakfasts and on SABC s Morning Live, and running a campaign of serial intimidation typified by one witness in the House of Assembly as having President Jacob Zuma on speed dial. Just how this unholy atmosphere was permitted to exist, says much for the dark subterranean currents of political power in this country. This must surely all end right now.
