The Young Communist League of SA would withdraw chairperson Yershen Pillay s candidacy for the National Youth Development Agency (NYDA) board should he not be reelected as chairperson, secretary Mluleki Dlelanga said. I spoke with comrade Yershen about this matter. Yershen cannot be led by people who only possess an identity document and a matric certificate and tasked with a multimillion-rand [NYDA] budget the NYDA is a genuine youth organisation for the struggle of our young people and nothing else, Dlelanga said, while delivering the YCLSA political report at its four-day YCLSA national congress held in Soweto. Pillay is also the incumbent NYDA board chairperson. He and 13 other candidates have been shortlisted for new the NYDA board selection process by parliament s ad hoc joint committee tasked with the appointment of the youth organisation s board members. Interviewing of the candidates would commence in parliament in January. The other candidates are Joy Maimela, Zandile Myeni, Zandile Majozi, Siyaduma Biniza, African National Congress Youth League deputy president Desmond Moela, league NEC member Thembinkosi Josopu, Ndomiso Mokako, Sifiso Mtsweni, Kenneth Morolong, Bavelile Hlongwa, Andile Biyela, Zilondiwe Goge and Siyabonga Magadla. The ad hoc committee has until March to finalise the selection process. President Jacob Zuma will then appoint successful candidates to the board on recommendation by parliament.
