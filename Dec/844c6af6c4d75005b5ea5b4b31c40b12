Former Proteas batsman Boeta Dippenaar has cast doubt over whether AB de Villiers will be &#8220;truly happy&#8221; when he returns to the Test side. De Villiers on Monday evening announced he was stepping down as South Africa&#8217;s captain in the five-day format after failing to recover in time from an elbow injury for the Test series against Sri Lanka &#8211; handing the role to Faf du Plessis. Some people find his decision appealing as it might grant him more freedom as a batsman but Dippenaar believes that may not be the case. Also read: AB de Villiers ditches Test captaincy permanently &#8220;I&#8217;ll admit I haven&#8217;t had much time to digest the matter yet,&#8221; he said on Tuesday. &#8220;Of course, one hopes AB scores lots of runs now because he doesn&#8217;t have to worry about captaincy matters anymore. But we&#8217;re still in the dark a bit about what his intentions really were. &#8220;Is he really at peace with his decision or did he have to force himself? Is he ready to merely be a senior player again?&#8221; Dippenaar may have a point. De Villiers has never kept his desire to be Test captain a secret. In fact, last season he tried &#8211; without explicitly saying so &#8211; to express his disappointment at being overlooked in favour of Hashim Amla. During the series against England, De Villiers complained about his workload and didn&#8217;t try to quash rumours over his international retirement. A week later, Amla resigned and De Villiers took over. He never complained after that again. Yet Peter Kirsten, another former Protea stalwart, says the &#8220;unselfish&#8221; De Villiers needn&#8217;t be worried. &#8220;He&#8217;s still the one-day captain. That should satisfy his hunger to captain,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Personally I would prefer to give Faf du Plessis the one-day captaincy as well as he&#8217;s really proved himself as a calm, thoughtful leader. But AB is also competent.&#8221; Naturally, Kirsten finds the prospect of De Villiers, who averages 50.46 in Tests, being unshackled as batsman very appealing. &#8220;Gosh, that&#8217;s a scary thought for any opposition bowling attack isn&#8217;t it? He very much remains the Proteas&#8217; most dangerous batter. The only question is who he&#8217;ll replace because South Africa have coped very nicely without him.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter. &nbsp;
