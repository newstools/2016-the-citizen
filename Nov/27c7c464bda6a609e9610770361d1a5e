A Germiston engineer has lost the first skirmish in his legal battle for compensation after a swab was allegedly left in his body during triple heart bypass surgery four years ago. Judge Nomsa Khumalo ruled in the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria last week that the claim instituted by Malcolm Kilmister lacked the necessary allegations to sustain his claim against the Glynnwood hospital in Johannesburg. She gave Kilmister, 71, leave to amend the particulars of his claim against the hospital. Kilmister instituted a R1.2 million damages claim against the hospital and cardiovascular surgeon Dr Johannes Brink, after a swab was allegedly left in his chest during heart bypass surgery at the hospital in July 2012. A temporary pacemaker was also inserted, but the forgotten swab was still not found when the pacemaker was removed. The swab was only discovered at a later stage and several of his ribs had to be cut during a third operation to remove the swab almost a month later. By that time, infection had already set in and Kilmister experienced severe pain and shock. He claimed in court papers he still suffered from chronic pain and discomfort and needed further medical treatment, surgery and physiotherapy, was disfigured and suffered a loss of amenities of life due to pain. He alleged the staff and the surgeon were to blame for negligently failing to remove the swab during the first operation and were dutybound to have done so, and for failing to have x-rays of his chest taken timeously. The hospital insisted there was no causal link between the damage Kilmister had suffered and any omission by the nursing staff. ilsed@citizen.co.za
