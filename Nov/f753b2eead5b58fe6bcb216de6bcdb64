A person who goes by the name of Craze A Williams on Facebook yesterday called on coloured people to stand together against darkies and beat and burn black people. It&#8217;s understood his name is actually Angelo Williams. Craze A Williams&#8217; Facebook post. He said black people should not be allowed on the streets of Eersterust, a predominantly coloured area in the east of Pretoria, after 5pm. Williams wrote this hateful post on the Eersterust Nuusblad, causing a flood of negative responses towards the remarks. Most people were asking him to stop. However, this only angered him more and he responded by telling people to go back to the funny farm and that they would remain stupid. According to his Facebook bio, he has worked for a vehicle company, Ford. . Williams said what was posted was nothing like what Penny Sparrow posted. When asked what his real name was, Williams said: Do me a favour put in the paper there is a difference between what I posted and what Sparrow posted; hoop jy het ook genoeg geld om jou bass te red (I hope you have enough money to save your own skin).&#8221; . He added: By the way I am not racist, but just being realistic because coloureds don t feature anywhere. Some users reacted by saying they had relationships with black people, that all coloureds had black blood in their veins and that he should stop his racism. . He went on to say that if a darkie should call him a boesman then I start to bliksem . . Williams then said coloureds were the biggest clowns that submitted to whatever bulls**t was thrown at them because white and black people take us for asses and still laugh in our faces . He subsequently delete all his initial posts and responses to them.
