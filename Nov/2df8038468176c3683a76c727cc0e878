Safety at OR Tambo International Airport in Gauteng has been severely comprised in the past few weeks with reports of criminal activity on the increase, the Democratic Alliance said on Sunday. Travellers who arrived late at the airport had complained to the DA that they felt unsafe walking to the parking garage and to catch a taxi-cab, DA Gauteng MPL Michele Clarke said. As a national key point, I have been alarmed at the very little visible SAPS [SA Police Service] and metro police presence; this despite the Ekurhuleni metro police department having a satellite station based at the airport. I have been followed to my car on three occasions and in one instance I was accosted by a group of young men asking for money, she said. Travellers were often followed from the airport and then hijacked and attacked upon arrival at their destination. Last Saturday an Uber driver was hijacked and fatally shot at the airport. The safety of travellers who access the airport should be a priority 24/7, the party said. I have discussed this matter with Gauteng community safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane and will now request an urgent intervention in writing. Gauteng is the number one business travel destination in the country and with this reputation safety at our main port of entry to the province must be prioritised, Clarke said.
