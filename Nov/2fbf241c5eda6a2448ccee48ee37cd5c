Is there something ironic about President Jacob Zuma claiming during a rally in the remote eDumbe local municipality in KwaZulu-Natal to celebrate the party s first municipal elections victory there that his political opponents ran to the courts after losing battles in parliament, typifying this as a misinterpretation of democracy , or have his words lost something in translation? This, we would tend to think, is a tactic the president is well-versed in. Certainly, Zuma s assertions were subsumed in his bold declaration that the spectre of imprisonment held no terrors. Even if I am arrested today, I am used to it. I was in jail for 10 years, so you cannot scare me, he told the citizens of eDumbe.

But we would have to also admit the embattled ANC leader, his party cleft down the spine and the chorus of his vocal critics rapidly growing to a crescendo, that raising the thought of being re-incarcerated comes at a particularly difficult time. The question that may yet come back to haunt him is, why did he raise it in the first place?
