The Democratic Alliance (DA) will file a supplementary affidavit in its court case against SABC corporate affairs group executive Hlaudi Motsoeneng after more evidence emerged in the media on Sunday, detailing Motsoeneng s &#8220;obvious unfitness&#8221; to hold any senior position at the SABC, the DA said. As the DA s case against Motsoeneng is set to be heard on Wednesday and Thursday, 23 and 24 November 2016, the DA will now file a supplementary affidavit containing the information revealed in the media today [Sunday], which will add to the already extensive list of reasons as to why Mr Motsoeneng is wholly unfit to hold any position at the national broadcaster and why he should be removed immediately, DA federal executive chairman James Selfe said. The reports revealed that: Motsoeneng did not adhere to the SABC policy on request for proposals (RFP) approved in 2014 and thereby defied the SABC s own commissioning policy; By ignoring those RFP procedures and then failing to approve a new commissioning protocol policy, as industry watchdog the Independent Communications Authority of SA (Icasa) required, Motsoeneng contravened Icasa regulations; Motsoeneng bullied and abused the SABC s former group executive for television Verona Duwarkah; Motsoeneng implemented the 80 percent local TV content quota without conducting a risk assessment; and Motsoeneng commissioned R600 million worth of local TV shows for which he brought in celebrity actors as producers, through a back door. In October, the DA filed its founding affidavit in the Western Cape High Court to have the appointment of Motsoeneng as group executive of corporate affairs declared invalid, Selfe said. In essence, the DA is asking the court to confirm that Mr Motsoeneng is unfit to hold any position at the SABC. While it is not ideal to approach the courts, the DA firmly believes that the SABC board, now comprising of one member, and the Minister of Communications Faith Muthambi have failed in their duty to maintain the integrity of the national broadcaster. Therefore the DA was left with little choice but to request that the courts intervene, in the interest of the public, to prevent Motsoeneng from continuing his one-man wrecking ball routine . The DA was committed to restoring the integrity and independence of the SABC. The first vital step towards this objective was Motsoeneng s removal, Selfe said.
