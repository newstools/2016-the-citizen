 Drug dealers, your days of poisoning our people are numbered. You are going to jail. This was the warning from Tshwane metro police spokesperson Senior Superintendent Isaac Mahamba. He said his unit s drug team had arrested 77 alleged drug dealers between September 28 and October 28. We have taken drugs worth more than R268 540 off the streets of Tshwane and plan to ensure we get them all, Mahamba vowed. By taking the dealers off the streets, we are giving the young drug addicts their lives back. The metro s drug team was one of the units Tshwane executive mayor Solly Msimanga has given more teeth. Mahamba said the drug team had also conducted spot-checks at schools, where pupils were tested for drugs. Many kids have tested positive for drugs and were arrested. They were later released into the care of their parents, Mahamba said. Most of the pupils tested positive for dagga. Mahamba said his team could not be bribed. There were incidents where drug dealers tried, but were instead slapped with an additional bribery charge, he said. My men are eager, hard-working and dedicated officers, doing everything they can to clean [up] the streets of Tshwane.
