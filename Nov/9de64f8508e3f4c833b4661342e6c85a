Kickoff: 4pm Tweets about #ITAvSA from:Jacobs_Rudolph The Boks started their tour with a 31-31 draw in a non-Test against the Barbarians before suffering a crushing 37-21 loss to England last weekend at Twickenham their first defeat to England in 10 years and 13 matches. Since the Boks beat Ireland 2-1 in June they have only won two of their next seven Tests, which resulted in just four wins from 10 this year after winning only two of their six games in the Rugby Championship. The Boks haven t tasted success since October 1 when they beat Australia 18-10 at Loftus, where flyhalf Morne Steyn was responsible for all of the Boks&#8217; points with the boot. This will be hooker Adriaan Strauss 11th Test as Bok skipper in his 65th Test and he will enjoy his swansong against Wales next weekend in Cardiff. Italy on the other hand are coming off a heavy 68-10 defeat to the All Blacks last weekend.
