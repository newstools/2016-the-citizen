Gareth van Zyl has started his training career with a bang and his charge Budapest has decent ability when in the mood and Race 7, a MR 85 Handicap over the Greyville Polytrack 1400m tonight could bring out the best in this four-year-old gelding. Admittedly Budapest has been a disappointment this year but the aggressive tactics jockey Anthony Delpech used when winning a feature at Kenilworth nearly a year ago have not really been used on Budapest since and hopefully his rider tonight, Warren Kennedy goes that way. This course and distance also plays nicely into such tactics. There are two others on this card who could pay to be with. Sovereign Reign returned from a break to win a 1000m race at Scottsville in October very easily so it was a bit of a surprise when unplaced in his next start. Marcus now takes over the reins and Race 6, a MR 76 Handicap over 1400m could be his for the taking. A pole position draw will enable Marcus to keep a handier than usual position for the Dynasty five-year-old gelding and he has a strong finish when in the mood. In Race 8he Alyson Wright-trained Roy Is Second was runner-up behind She s A Giver in June and that form took a huge boost when She s a Giver was a very easy feature race winner last weekend. Delpech has been retained for the ride. &nbsp; &nbsp;
