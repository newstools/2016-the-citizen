Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced that R3500 could be the new national minimum wage on Sunday afternoon. The deputy president says this is the amount his committee has seen fit to propose as the national minimum wage. He says, however, that there still needs to be a process to be followed before this amount is approved by certain sectors of the economy, such as business and government. &#8220;Once an agreement is struck here at Nedlac, it&#8217;s an agreement which will be sent to the legislature, and which will be then turned into law,&#8221; said Ramaphosa. &#8220;There is no agreement as yet; what we&#8217;ve agreed on is a process. Right now there&#8217;s no agreement, we are urging all parties to consult. &#8220;Will business, unions and government agree to this? No! This is a process we&#8217;ve all looked forward to. &#8220;Now there&#8217;s a figure around the table. So let&#8217;s have a discussion. &#8220;Whoever is paying low wages, adjust yourselves. We need to move higher. Is this a living wage? No. This is not a living wage.&#8221; This is what people had to say on Twitter: One of the unintended consequence of #MinimumWage might be casualization of certain job categories. &mdash; State Captured (@tmabaso101) November 20, 2016 Will this be R3500 in 2/3 years time?
