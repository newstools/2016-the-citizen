The Up! is VW s smallest new car and an altogether more serious stab at building a proper city car that I&#8217;d actually want to buy. Volkswagen has taken its creation very seriously and, remarkably, intends this to be its biggest-selling model globally. .

The new model comes equipped with LED daytime running lights, modified bumper with redesigned front trim strips and a more contoured bonnet.
