Trade union Solidarity on Monday served former South African Broadcasting Corporation Chief Operating Officer, Hlaudi Motsoeneng with papers to cover the costs of the lawsuit between him and the so-called SABC 8 journalists. Solidarity, which acted on behalf of the unlawfully dismissed SABC 8 journalists in their lawsuit against the SABC, is now approaching the court together with the Broadcasting Electronic Media Allied Workers&#8217; Union (BEMAWU) to hold Motsoeneng accountable for the two trade unions legal costs in his personal capacity. According to the head of Solidarity s Centre for Fair Labour Practices, Anton van Der Bijl, Motsoeneng has to be held accountable for the decision to terminate the journalists contracts.

Although Simon Tebele ultimately carried out the instruction to dismiss the journalists, it is argued that Motsoeneng was the person who gave the instruction, Van der Bijl said. Van der Bijl said Motsoeneng s action caused the SABC grave embarrassment. The Labour Court s ruling proves that his decision to dismiss the journalists was unlawful. This case will ensure that he is held accountable. Tebele, the newly appointed head of news at the SABC, will also be added as respondent in the case. The SABC was not immediately available for comment. African News Agency
