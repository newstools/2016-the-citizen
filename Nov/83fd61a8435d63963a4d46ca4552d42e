Red Special and Dukes Idol will clash again in Race 6 at Flamingo Park and it is likely to be closely fought out affair in this Pinnacle Stakes over 1400m. They have met twice in the last two months, once over 1400m and then again over 1200m. Dukes Idol came out on top in the 1 400m affair but he was trounced by Red Special in their last meeting, which was over 1 200m. There was three lengths separating the pair but when they meet this time Dukes Idol will be 3kg better off. There is little to be gleaned from the draws. However, the manner in which Red Special won last time makes one believe he could have the edge again. This Stephanie Miller-trained runner had quite a bit in hand and although this time they meet over 200m further, the four-year-old son of Kahal could maintain that form line. Gunter Wrogemann is aboard Red Special while Lyle Hewitson picks up the ride on Bill Human s charge. This is certainly not a two-horse race and one can make a case for a number of runners. Razzle My Tazzle has won his last two races and as a result of the six points his merit rating was increased for his last win, he comes into this event as the best handicapped runner. He actually carries 5.5kg less than last time and has Craig Zackey in the irons. Seattle Sunset attempted 1800m last time but failed to run on. He is far more at home over this distance and one can expect him to be a lot more competitive on this occasion. Black Toga had his first run at this course last time and will be a lot more aware of the conditions this time around. He will need to improve on his last start but Tienie Prinsloo s charge must be in with a chance. BEST BET RACE 5 NO 5 L&#8217; ATTITUDE VALUE BET RACE 8 NO 10 SIR CECIL
