A video footage showing a brutal assault of a driver on Umhlanga Rocks Drive in KwaZulu-Natal has surfaced. The video, which was captured by a local resident who did not want to be named, shows two men from a BMW X5 assaulting a driver, Northglen News reported. The men are believed to be bodyguards linked to a prominent La Lucia family. I was driving down Umhlanga Rocks Drive, near Somerset Drive. The cars were slowing down around me, and I saw some commotion ahead of me. I saw a BMW with flashing lights, and I thought there had be an accident or an incident. I saw two men in suits, carrying pistols, punching the driver of a white Toyota,&#8221; said the witness. That s when I decided to film the incident. I asked them what are they doing, but they ignored me and continued to harass the driver of the Toyota. The guys then got back in their vehicle and made a U-turn and drove off. I spoke to the victim afterwards, and he said he had made a mistake while driving, and that s when the men became violent. I said we all make mistakes, but you can t assault someone for it, he said. He added the victim had reportedly opened a case at Durban North Police Station. Provincial police spokesperson Thulani Zwane said he was aware of the incident but was not sure if a case had been opened. We have been in touch with the victim, and he was advised to open a case at the Durban North SAPS. We cannot say at this stage who the men in the video are, said Zwane. &#8211; Caxton News Service
