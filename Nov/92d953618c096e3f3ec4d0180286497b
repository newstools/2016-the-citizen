United Nations. The United States on Friday proposed that South Sudan s rebel leader Riek Machar, its army chief and its information minister face UN sanctions for fueling violence in the war-torn country.Machar, President Salva Kiir s army chief Paul Malong and his information minister Michael Makuei are on a sanctions blacklist circulated to the Security Council, in a text seen by AFP.Under the proposed measure, Machar, who is receiving medical treatment in South Africa, and the two senior officials would face a global travel ban and an assets freeze.The sanctions list was presented after the United States on Thursday put forward a draft resolution on imposing an arms embargo on South Sudan, where a civil war has raged since December 2013.In the document sent to the council, the United States said Machar had declared war on Kiir s government in September after fleeing the capital during heavy fighting two months earlier.The former vice president has entered into alliances with militia groups in Equatoria province to overthrow the government. Those forces have raided villages, abducted civilians and aid workers, the document said.The United States accused Malong of trying to kill Machar who had returned to Juba under heavy international pressure to serve in a national unity government.Malong, the military chief of staff since 2014, was responsible for efforts to kill opposition leader Riek Machar and knowingly disobeyed Kiir s orders by sending tanks, helicopter gunships and troops to assault Machar s residence in July.After Machar fled Juba, Malong wanted the army to attack his position immediately and informed army commanders that Machar was not to be taken alive, the document said.Information minister Makuei was cited for ordering the closure of the Juba airport in April to prevent the return of Machar to the capital.He also declared that South Sudan would treat troops from a proposed UN regional force as invaders if they deployed without Juba s approval, the document said.Russia last year blocked a previous bid by the United States to blacklist Malong along with top rebel commander, Major General Johnson Olony.Angola, China and Venezuela also opposed the move. The council has imposed sanctions on six commanders -- three from the government side and three among the rebels. Russia has made clear it opposes an arms embargo, arguing that it would further sour relations between South Sudan s leadership and the international community. (AFP)
