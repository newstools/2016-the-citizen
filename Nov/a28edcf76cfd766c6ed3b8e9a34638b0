Arusha. The East African Court of Justice (EACJ) expects more cases on trade aspects now that its jurisdiction has been extended to cover trade and investments issues. We hope there will be an increase in the cases concerning trade aspects as the Common Market protocol is in its implementation progress, said Registrar of the regional Court Yufnalis Okubo.The Court is yet to start handling cases on human rights violations and crimes against humanity despite repeated pleas to the East African Community (EAC) Heads of State for it to be given such powers.Briefing reporters on EACJ activities for this year, Mr Okubo said they also expect cases to be filed by aggrieved parties on disputes or matters associated with the East African Monetary Union. This year, the Court has received 28 cases, making a total of the suits, which it has handled since its establishment in 2001, to 51.And in order to speed up hearing of the cases, EACJ has introduced case management and recording system which will enable the litigants to file their cases electronically from whichever location to avoid the costs of travelling to and from Arusha as well as time-saving. In addition, the Court has developed law reports, which have greatly contributed to capacity building of Judges and staff of the Court, Mr Okubo said, emphasising that the major role of the judicial organ was to ensure the adherence to law in the interpretation and application of and compliance of the EAC Treaty.On human rights cases, he said the EAC Heads of State have concurred that for the time being, such cases arising in the region should be taken to the African Court on Human and People s Rights (AfCHPR), a judicial organ of the African Union (AU) based in Arusha.The Registrar added that due to the low awareness of the Court within the region, EACJ has now taken an active role in judicial activities and programmes in the EAC partner states and these include training of judicial officers in the national judiciaries to familiarize with the procedures of the regional Court.The Court has also been able to reach out to people by attending in the annual conferences of the Magistrates and Judges in East Africa and the Commonwealth and participating in the Kenya judiciary awareness week, among others.
