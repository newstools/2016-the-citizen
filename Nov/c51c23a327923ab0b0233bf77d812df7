Nairobi. Former presidential candidate Peter Kenneth has resigned from his Kenya National Congress party as he prepares to launch his bid for the Nairobi governor s seat on a Jubilee Party ticket. Mr Kenneth dropped his presidential ambitions to support the re-election of President Kenyatta. He apparently sought the simplest way to stop the attacks from some Jubilee Party MPs, who last week gave him a two-week ultimatum to dissolve his Congress party. The former Gatanga MP wrote to the Registrar of Political Parties, Ms Lucy Ndung u, last week, tendering his resignation as a member of the the party.
