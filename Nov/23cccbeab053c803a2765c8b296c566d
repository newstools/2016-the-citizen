Maybe we should look at it in the light of other chapter nine institutions whose recommendations are a bit strong so that it doesn t just become a recommendation that is dependent on an accounting officer or executive authority in terms of whether they want to implement it, said Smith. Unless or until their are consequences, I think we re going to have a problem. At some point I m going to lobby certain people to strengthen the AG s powers. In the same briefing Makwetu revealed irregular expenditure cost South Africa R46.3 billion in the 2015/16 financial year. This was a 80 percent increase on the irregular expenditure recorded since the 2012/13 financial year. African News Agency
