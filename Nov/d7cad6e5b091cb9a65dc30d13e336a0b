Former African Nation Congress Western Cape provincial chairman Marius Fransman on Thursday said he would seek a judicial review of the party s National Disciplinary Committee s decision to suspend him. Fransman in a statement, titled An immoral onslaught of criminal proportions again blamed his suspension on factional battles in the Western Cape and nationally, hitting out at, among others, ANC secretary General Gwede Mantashe, his former provincial deputy Khaya Magaxa and provincial secretary Faiez Jacobs. I am appealing the finding of the disciplinary committee, and am also seeking judicial review, said Fransman.

He was referring to a media briefing by Magaxa on Tuesday in which he said Fransman should stop blaming his woes on Mantashe and spreading stories about the secretary general working him out of the party so a faction in the province loyal to Mantashe could support him for the deputy presidency of the party during the national elective conference in 2017. Fransman was suspended on November 10 after the NDC found him guilty of two charges of misconduct. One relates to him attempting to obtain sexual favours from Louisa Wynand during a trip to this year s ANC annual birthday celebrations in Rustenburg. The other charge related to him making public statements which brought the party into disrepute. The NDC said that the charged member showed no political understanding of one of the fundamental objectives of the ANC viz, the support for and advancement of women s emancipation, the committee said in a statement at the time. &#8211; African News Agency
