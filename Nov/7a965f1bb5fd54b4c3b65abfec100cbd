The Western Cape Education Department (WCED) has confirmed that it is conducting an investigation into allegations of racism and discrimination made by pupils of the Waterloo Boarding House at Wynberg Girls High School. On Monday, pupils released a statement to the media and on social networks containing allegations of racism, discrimination and misconduct. A departmental district official went to the school on Monday afternoon and met with the pupils once they had completed their exam. Western Cape education MEC Debbie Schafer said the WCED would conduct an investigation into all allegations made and that the pupils would not be victimised in any way for voicing their concerns. I am informed that the circuit Mmnager provided the hostel learners with her mobile number and said they should contact her at any stage, added Schafer. Schafer said that in conducting the investigation, the department would be mindful that the pupils were still in the process of writing their final exams, which are only due to conclude on November 28. We appeal to the media to respect this fact and not disrupt schooling, said Schafer. Schafer said there would be no timeline on the investigation, as it was a thorough process that would require interviewing all parties involved. I would also like to remind learners that they can report any serious concerns directly to the department via the Safe Schools hotline on 0800 45 46 47, added Schafer.
