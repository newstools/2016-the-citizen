The South African Broadcasting Cooperation s (SABC) recent 80% television local content quota is reportedly plunging the public broadcaster s English medium channel SABC3, with advertising and audiences ratings continuing to fall. ALSO READ: Luthuli House meeting was convenient for Zuma and Abrahams Masutha City Press reported at the weekend before group executive of corporate affairs Hlaudi Motsoeneng announced the new local content regime for television SABC1 had a 95% local content rate, SABC2 a 75% rate and SABC3 had 45%. The paper reported figures show that the new schedules and quotas introduced had an almost immediate effect with profits on SABC3, down by almost 35% in July already, and continue to slide. According to SABC insiders who spoke to the paper anonymously, in October, SABC3 posted a loss for the first time since the new measure were implemented. The channel reached 50% of its advertising quotas, earning only half of what it had earned in advertising revenue this time last year. The changing of schedules added to the SABC s woes as well as unusable international content that had already been bought or licensed. SABC insiders told the City Press they only heard about the local content quotas in the newspapers, while some said they were called to a meeting a few days after the announcement and asked how it would be implemented. SABC 3 s most popular show, The Bold and the Beautiful, had 1.5 million viewers in June before the new schedules was introduced. Last month, the soapie had just less than 1 million viewers.

Acting SABC chief operating officer Bessie Tugwana said the channels had been in decline for years, while Motsoeneng said that he was a risk-taker and risks must be taken for the channels to succeed.
