Following reports he had travelled on a Guptas jet at the behest of Duduzane Zuma, the Mpumalanga premier has clarified his relationship with the politically connected family. Despite catching a lift with the Guptas on their private jet from Moscow, Russia, and allegedly promising to place R7 million worth of advertising in The New Age, Mabuza said he had no business links to the influential family. According to Sowetan, Mabuza&#8217;s spokesperson, Zibonele Mcwango, the premier is his own person and is not &#8216;captured&#8217; by the Guptas. The paper further reported that Mabuza has distanced himself from the &#8216;premier league&#8217;, which consists of Free State Premier Ace Magashule and North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo, who have publicly declared their support for the Guptas.
