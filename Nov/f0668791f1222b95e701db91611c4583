Two unbeaten fillies, Karatage and African Sunbird, are set to clash in Race 8, the KZN 3YO Series Fillies (Non-Black Type) over 1600m on Sunday. Karatage was heavily backed when beating Savannah Cat over the Scottsville 1400m in October and she may pack too much class for some fair fillies who compete against her. It is not easy to win on debut and it is even tougher to do it over that particular course and distance but the Kahal filly did it with a touch of class. Savannah Cat is carded to run tonight so that run needs to be looked at. The Charles Laird-trained African Sunbird quickened nicely when winning on debut and the step up in distance should suit this Trippi filly but she will need to do more this time as the runner-up the day she won Night At The Proms does seem to be a bit of a battler. Miss Minver and Beaute Noire have both clearly shown to have ability and cannot just be dismissed. It is a fact that Dean Kannemeyer-trained runners make good improvement on their debuts and Arran Isles showed promise when runner-up behind Varsonic this month. Race 1, a Maiden Plate over 1200m on the Polytrack looks hers for the taking. The very same combination of Kannemeyer and Anthony Delpech could also win Race 2 as Prince Myshkin is ready to win. A wide draw of stall No 11 does look a tough task but Prince Myshkin showed promise when runner-up in his last two starts. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
