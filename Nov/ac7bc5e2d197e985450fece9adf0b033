A Rhodesfield resident s stroke of luck did not last long when he was robbed of R1 million he had won gambling. According to Ekurhuleni North District s Captain Neldah Sekgobela, the 43-year-old victim won the money after gambling at Emperors Palace last Sunday, Kempton Express reported. He and his daughter were held at gunpoint in their driveway as they arrived home while waiting for their remote-controlled gate to close behind them. The complainant says three men driving a black Renault Megane with no registration plates suddenly pulled up behind his car, added Sekgobela. All the men surrounded his car, and one of them pointed a firearm at him, demanding the money he had won at Emperors Palace, as well as an additional R20 000 that was inside his daughter s handbag, she said. Cellphones that were inside the handbag were also stolen. Julie van Wyk, Peermont Hotels, Casinos and Resorts public relations manager, confirmed management was aware of the incident. The South African Police Service has opened a criminal case and Emperors Palace management ensures its full support and cooperation with the police investigation. No further comment will be made at this stage, as the matter is sub judice, Van Wyk said. Sekgobela confirmed that a case of armed robbery is being investigated. &#8211; Caxton News Service
