ER24 paramedics were returning to their branch when they were flagged down by Ekurhuleni Metro Police Department (EMPD) officers, ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said. Upon arrival, paramedics found seven men seated on the sidewalk surrounded by local authorities. Paramedics assessed the men and found that all seven men had sustained minor to moderate injuries. ER24 paramedics treated the patients and thereafter transported four of them to a nearby hospital. The remaining three men declined further treatment and transportation to hospital. The incident was being investigated, Meiring said.
