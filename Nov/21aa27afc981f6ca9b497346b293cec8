Mwanza. The fate of the membership to Parliament for Bunda Urban constituency, Ms Ester Bulaya (Chadema), will be known tomorrow when Judge Noel Chocha delivers judgement.Initially, Judge Chocha set the ruling for November 22, this year, before rescheduling it to this Friday.The election petition Number 1 of 2015 was filed by Magaomba Masato and three others asking the court to nullify the results which gave Ms Bulaya victory against CCM s candidate Stephen Wassira.The High Court Registrar in Mwanza, Mr Francis Kabwe, confirmed yesterday over the phone that he had received instructions to summon all parties for the judgement tomorrow. On November 11, I received information to summon the parties ready for the judgement on November 18, instead of the initial date set for November 22. I have already done so by sending summons to all parties, Mr Kabwe said.However, the Registrar said reasons behind the date rescheduling can only be given by Judge Chocha himself, who could not be reached for clarification yesterday.The judgment is being released in Musoma after a fresh hearing ordered by the Court of Appeal following an appeal filled by petitioners against Judge Mohamed Gwae s decision to truck off the case early this year.In his decision, Judge Gwae said despite the failure to mention the provisions and rules in which the court could be moved to determine the application, the applicants also failed to indicate the harm they suffered as voters. The applicants had asked the court to nullify Ms Bulaya s victory due to election irregularities.
