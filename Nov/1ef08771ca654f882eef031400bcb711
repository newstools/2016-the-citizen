A 43-year-old father was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in the Port Shepstone Regional Court for repeatedly raping his 13-year-old daughter, KwaZulu-Natal police said on Monday. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said the father appeared for repeatedly raping his daughter during 2014. A nightmare no young girl would ever want to experience. She was too terrified to do anything because the man who was supposed to care for her and protect her had repeatedly violated her and threatened to kill her if she told anyone of his reprehensible behaviour.&#8221; ALSO READ: Alleged dealers nabbed with drugs worth R2.5m in KZN She eventually summoned up enough courage and confided in her best friend and a close relative that from 1 February 2014 until 1 June 2014, her father had repeatedly raped her, said Mbhele. The matter was reported to the Port Shepstone SAPS for investigation and the case was investigated by Port Shepstone Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences unit (FCS). The father was immediately arrested and detained on a charge of rape. In passing sentence, the court also declared the father unfit to possess a firearm. African News Agency
