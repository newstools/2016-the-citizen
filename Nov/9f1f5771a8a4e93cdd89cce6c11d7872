While some try to keep their relationships under wraps, Ntombezinhle &#8216;DJ Zinhle&#8217; Jiyane and her beau, Brendon Naidoo, seem to be doing everything they can to show their love for all to see. DJ Zinhle at first posted subtle hints that she found someone then said in an interview her man wore expensive suits. She gradually started posting pictures of his arm, showing his watches, and then eventually posted the man himself, though she made sure we could not see his face. However, she broke the internet the day she finally posted a picture showing Brendon Naidoo&#8217;s face. Since then, the two have been publicly sending each other sweet messages. On Thursday, the DJ shared that she would be on the cover of the December issue of True Love magazine. Fans responded with eagerness to see the issue, but it was Brendon&#8217;s comment that caught the DJ&#8217;s eye. Hello December!
