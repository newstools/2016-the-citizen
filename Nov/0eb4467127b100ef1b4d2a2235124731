As many were shocked by the news of the self-proclaimed prophet from Limpopo who has used Doom to &#8220;heal&#8221; his congregants, some used the news as an opportunity to troll celebrities using memes. Unathi Msengana is one of the celebrities who often gets targeted by such memes based on a past photo of hers. It started when the Aromat memes were still trending, with one saying she looked better after being seasoned with it. Now a Doom meme has been created, implying that she was made beautiful because of it. The pesticide had gained pop culture currency with memes saying that if it could &#8220;heal&#8221; those congregants, then it can solve any problem one might have. Sharing a past picture of the Idols SA judge, one Twitter user tweeted the meme and tagged a Zanu_pf account, saying it needed Doom. &#8220;If we use Doom on white trolls they may mutate,&#8221; the account tweeted back. Msengana saw the tweets and hit back, saying she looked like that because she had been sick at the time. &#8220;Stop with your lies. I was sick here. IM BORED. Sies,&#8221; she tweeted. If we use doom on white trolls they may mutate. https://t.co/6CDHBfR5nB &mdash; ZANU PF (@zanu_pf) November 21, 2016 Msengana further said that she blocked the trolls. She is, unfortunately, not the only celebrity who has fallen victim to the memes. Bongekile &#8216;Babes Wodumo&#8217; Simelane&#8217;s name has now been changed to &#8220;Babes WoDoomo&#8221; in memes doing the rounds on social media. A past picture of hers has been photoshopped, with her hand now appearing as if she has been holding Doom all along. Picture: Instagram. While some saw the Doom memes as an opportunity to make fun of celebs, singer Dr Malinga used the trend to his advantage and created a &#8220;song&#8221; out of it. He took to Instagram to share his new creation. Read more: WATCH: Dr Malinga&#8217;s Doom song: Part 1
