Based on the way they are betting, bookmakers appear to be groping in the dark as to who will win the R2 million Sansui Summer Cup at Turffontein Racecourse on Saturday, November 26. Those who were hoping for some guidance to the outcome of last Saturday s Charity Mile were probably left with more questions than answers, with only Deo Juvente, last year s runner-up, who finished third, and second-placed KwaZulu-Natal visitor Saratoga Dancer enhancing their reputations. The good run of Deo Juvente will have pleased trainer Geoff Woodruff, whose runners have dominated this race for the last three years. Woodruff has also nominated last year s winner, Master Sabina, who is currently quoted at 10/1 to repeat that victory, with Deo Juvente at 11/1. Saratoga Dancer, who is trained in KwaZulu-Natal by Duncan Howells, has also shortened to 10/1 after his close second behind New Predator in the Charity Mile. Topping the boards for the Grade 1 race over 2 000 metres are two runners from the yard of champion trainer Sean Tarry Liege and Samurai Blade. Liege, who will probably be ridden by champion jockey S manga Khumalo, is favourite at 8/1, with his stable companion, who is expected to have Piere Strydom in the irons, at 9/1. Samurai Blade will be running at Turffontein in Race 2 tomorrow evening and will probably need to win in order to cement his place in the final field which will be announced next Wednesday.
