The Vaughan Marshall-trained Secret Is Out showed how good she was as a two-year-old with some smashing wins last season. The Captain Al filly won all three of her starts and is already a Grade 1 winner. Clearly The Secret Is Out needed her three-year-old debut as she only finished seventh in that comeback run, but a wide draw and carrying top-weight could also have contributed to that result. However she was doing her best work at the finish. A big advantage for her this time is the inside draw she has and looks the right one in Race 7, a Progress Plate over 1400m at Kenilworth today. Trainer Dennis Drier has been quick to get his Western Cape raiders into the winner s box and Sail was ahead of The Secret Is Out last time. This Philanthropist filly was also doing her best at the finish of that race. Stable companion to Sail is the unbeaten Premier Dance. This filly won over Greyville 1400m on the Polytrack in September and then quickened nicely when beating Trippi s Girl recently at this course. Clearly another class horse in the race is Nightingale. This Silvano filly will find the 1400m short of ideal and this run is probably being used to get her ready for some of the bigger features later this season. &nbsp; &nbsp;
