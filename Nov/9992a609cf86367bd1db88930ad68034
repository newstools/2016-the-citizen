Restaurant Mosaic, the acclaimed Gauteng restaurant, has taken the No 5 spot in the Top 10 of the Mercedes-Benz Eat Out Awards. Mosaic, which celebrates a decade of excellence, is the only Gauteng restaurant (and the only one outside of the Western Cape) on the coveted list of eateries. It is situated in Elandsfontein, Pretoria. Restaurant Mosaic has been a top 10 contender in the MercedesBenz Eat Out Restaurant Awards for the past eight years, together with Chantel Dartnall twice winning Chef of the Year (in 2009 and again in 2014). Fellow chef David Higgs, one of this year s three judges for the awards, described Mosaic as providing impressive, superior food and a seasonal menu where boundaries are pushed in a magical setting . Says Dartnall: We are delighted to be ranked among the best restaurants in South Africa. There are so many passionate and hardworking chefs out there, so that to be selected from such an illustrious group is indeed an honour and a humbling experience. Dartnall s vision for the next 10 years remains the same: to celebrate excellence in food and wine; creating memorable and romantic occasions for her guests and embracing all things beautiful, while staying dedicated to a vision of consistency and commitment. Mosaic is a destination and a celebration of life, says Dartnall.
