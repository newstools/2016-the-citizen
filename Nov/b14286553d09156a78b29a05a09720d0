BLM Naturals has announced that Muvhango star Liteboho Molise has joined the natural hair movement. Molise joins the large number of women across South Africa who have heeded the call to #FreeYourHair and transition to natural hair this summer. For me, natural hair is a conscious choice, she said. To proudly and boldly wear my curls is to celebrate myself as an African woman. Natural hair for me is more than just a fashion statement; it s an affirmation of my culture and identity.
