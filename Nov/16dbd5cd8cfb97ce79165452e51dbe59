It is feared they might have been killed following the recent abduction and subsequent killing of other refugees near the refugee hosting area of Lasu Payam. The fatal shooting and machete attack by armed groups killed two and wounded five refugees from the Kordofan region. Meanwhile, four women and 28 children are still in captivity in an unknown location following their abduction from a refugee centre in late October. The captors entered the settlement and asked refugees to present their food ration cards for food distribution mobilisation, allegedly on behalf of the United Nations (UN). A UN spokesperson said they were attempting to obtain details about the whereabouts of the abducted group and their captors. Prior to the raids, Lasu hosted over 10,000 refugees. The camp is now empty.
