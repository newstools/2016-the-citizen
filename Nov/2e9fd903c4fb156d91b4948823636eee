Dar es Salaam. Editors have criticised the way President John Magufuli s maiden press conference was organised and conducted.According to a review of the November 4 event at State House the moderators Tanzania Broadcasting Corporation (TBC) Director General Ayoub Rioba and Uhai Productions Managing Director Tido Mhando dictated proceedings and did not give journalists the opportunity to ask follow-up questions.Editors said during a postmortem facilitated by the Tanzania Media Foundation (TMF) that nobody was allowed to ask supplementary questions after the President had answered the main one.Mr Balinagwe Mwambungu of New Habari Corporation said the moderators were supposed to at least give journalists the opportunity to ask additional questions or ask the President on their behalf . That is why the public is now complaining that important questions such as the one asked by Pascal Mayalla were not answered comprehensively, and no supplementary questions came up, he said.The moderators also came under fire for choosing for the President which questions to answer, and editors cited as an example the question on industrial development, which was trashed by Dr Rioba, who asked the Head of State to ignore it.Ms Joyce Shebe of Clouds Media Group also took issue with time management during the event. Time management was poor because they failed to ensure that as many questions as possible were asked during the limited time set aside for the press conference, she said.Moderators selection of people who asked questions also came under fire, with Mr Suleiman Msuya of Jambo Leo saying it was based on familiarity and seniority of the participants, something locked out many journalists.New Habari Corporation Editor-in-Chief Absalom Kibanda wondered whether the event was a press conference at all, saying there were many participants who did not come from any media house. These are the people who kept on clapping as the President spoke, and this projected a negative and misleading image to the world of a media that grovelled before the Head of State. Tanzania Editors Forum (TEF) Secretary Neville Meena said TEF was not involved in organising the event and an invitation extended to the organisation at the eleventh hour. TEF chairman Theophil Makunga said there was a need to introduce State House correspondents to streamline and facilitate communication between the two sides.In his closing remarks, TMF Executive Director Ernest Sungura said his organisation was ready to play a pivotal role in preparations for the next State House press conference. We are also ready to fund preparations for the TEF Five Year Strategic Plan, which should hopefully cover the State House correspondents issue, he said.Earlier, TEF board member Jesse Kwayu said they were waiting for the Media Services Act, 2016 in order to know what the way forward would be for media fraternity.
