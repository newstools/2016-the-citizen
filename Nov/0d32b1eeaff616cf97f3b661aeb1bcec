A 25-year-old taxi driver was attacked and shot dead by another taxi driver near Seshego Police Station outside Polokwane, Limpopo police said on Monday. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the motive for the killing on Sunday was not yet clear and that possible road rage was not ruled out. Two taxis stopped at a red robot and a driver alighted and ran to the one in front. He slapped the other driver with open hands, produced a firearm and shot him to death at close range while he was still behind the steering wheel, said Ngoepe. Police confiscated a firearm and ammunition from the alleged shooter. The 30-year-old taxi driver from Mabokelele village, in Moletjie, outside Polokwane is facing a charge of murder and is expected to appear in the Seshego Magistrates Court soon.
