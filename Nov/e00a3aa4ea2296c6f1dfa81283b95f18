Idols SA has confirmed that one of its judges Gareth Cliff has resigned from the show, shocking fans who thought he would stay longer. &#8220;We can confirm Mr. Gareth Cliff s resignation as a judge on Idols SA. &#8220;We are grateful for his contribution to the show over the last 11 seasons, and we wish him well with his future endeavors,&#8221; Idols SA said in a statement on Monday. Fans did not take the news well, with one Benedick Brand saying: &#8220;Sounds a lot like a deal was striked during the court case. Sounds like the case was settled with Mnet allowing him to finish this year on condition that he resigns at the end of the show. Cliff is no racist, that much we all know. Sad day.&#8221; Another said they wished it was Somizi resigning and not Cliff. &#8220;I wish it was Somizi resigning&#8230;He just overdoes everything and he is starting to annoy me rather than entertain because of his attention seeking tendencies&#8230;Anyway Gareth, you were a cool judge and idols will never be the same without you&#8230;You will be missed.&#8221; Cliff was temporarily axed from the show earlier this year after his comments about KwaZulu-Natal estate agent Penny Sparrow, who compared black Durban beachgoers to monkeys. Cliff had said her comments constituted free speech. His comments enraged Twitter, with some claiming he had always been racist, while DJ Sbu came to his defence, saying Cliff was &#8220;the last person anyone should call racist&#8221;. Cliff sued M-Net for R25 million, for wrongful dismissal and defamation. His lawyer said M-Net did not follow proper procedure during his dismissal. He won the case and was reinstated as a judge.
