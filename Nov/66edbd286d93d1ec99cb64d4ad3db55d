Leaders of opposition parties used yesterday s motion of no confidence debate against President Jacob Zuma to lay into the president, calling him a dictator. Congress of the People leader Mosiuoa Lekota said his party supported the motion. The constitution gives MPs the right to remove a person who violates the constitution and the law, Lekota said. United Democratic Movement leader Bantu Holomisa labelled ANC MPs wolves , saying they jump in their chairs like popcorn .

African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) leader Reverend Kenneth Meshoe said despite increased calls for Zuma to resign, he had stubbornly refused to do so. Our country desperately needs a principled leader. We pray for the replacement of those in government who have turned themselves into instruments of evil, Meshoe said. He said Zuma defied and ridiculed South Africans from different backrounds, including business leaders and politicians. The ACDP believes the time is now for Zuma to step down and go back to Nkandla to look after his cattle, chickens and livestock.
