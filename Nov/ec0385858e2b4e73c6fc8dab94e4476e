Three Malawian nationals, Uka Vasili, Mussa Kaswili and Jabu Bauleni Sailesi, will appear in the Rustenburg Magistrate s Court on Wednesday to face 57 counts of human trafficking and breaching the Immigration Act. The trio were arrested in Boitekong near Rustenburg on July 24, after Boitekong police found 57 undocumented children, aged between 11 and 21 years, in the back of a delivery truck. Eighteen of the children were girls and 39 boys. In a separate matter on the same day, former director of supply chain management in the North West department of rural, environment and agriculture development, Jessy Rakoma, will appear in the Molopo Magistrate s Court in Mmabatho, where he will face one count of corruption and one count of fraud. And in the Zeerust Magistrate s Court, also on Wednesday, 19 police officers and two immigration officers are set to appear on 65 counts of corruption. Botlhoko Shebe and 20 others were arrested in November last year for allegedly taking bribes from a syndicate of cigarette smugglers at the Kopfontein border post.
