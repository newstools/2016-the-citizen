A chicken with needles inserted through its head and tied to a pole was rescued at Casuarina Beach in KwaZulu-Natal today, North Coast Courier reports. It is unclear whether this was done as part of a religious ritual or animal cruelty. The chicken had two sewing needles poked through either side of its head. Ballito resident Warren Loader was doing landscaping work in Casuarina when he noticed the distressed chicken. I first saw the chicken on the shore at 10am. At first I did not really notice anything odd.&#8221; READ MORE: &#8216;High chicken&#8217; leads to dagga bust When I went back to the beach at about 1pm, I noticed that the chicken was still there. When I looked closer, I saw that the chicken s leg was tied to a pole and noticed what looked like sewing needles going through either side of the chicken s head. Being an animal lover, Loader s first instinct was to help the chicken. He untied and rushed the traumatised animal to the Ballito Veterinary Clinic. Despite the chicken s traumatised state, it seems that it will make a full recovery. Loader told The Courier that he has arranged to take the chicken to the Flag Animal Farm in Salt Rock. &#8211; Caxton News Service &nbsp;
