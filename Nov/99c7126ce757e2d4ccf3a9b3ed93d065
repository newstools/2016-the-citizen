The reckless manner in which this country s public funding is being mishandled is an indictment of those tasked with safeguarding the public purse. The auditor-general s revelations that what is loosely grouped together as irregular expenditure across government departments and state entities for the 2015-16 financial year stands at an almost unbelievable R46 billion, is shocking. But what can we seriously expect when our president tacitly endorses the outlay of millions on upgrades to his homestead in KwaZulu-Natal? It also graphically illustrates that it is a serious misnomer to call the chief culprits in the vanishing act this eye-watering shortfall represents civil servants . Clearly, taken as a whole, they are neither civil-minded, nor do they render any semblance of service to the taxpayers of this country. Juxtaposed against what can only be deemed to be systematic corruption and larceny on a grand scale, is the chaos which the #FeesMustFall has engendered. Even half the missing amount would provide the wherewithal for free tertiary education and still have more than enough to fill the R11 billion hole needed on top of R3 billion already outlayed to complete a scheme to provide residents in Limpopo s Mopani district with potable drinking water. This looting of the public purse has become endemic to a misdirected sense of entitlement, which stretches like some multi-headed hydra throughout the vastly top-heavy network of state, provincial and municipal employees, from the open hand at a traffic stop to the opulent redecoration of offices only allocated to top officials courtesy of the long-suffering tax and ratepayers. It is in this unsavoury trough that the culprits wallow and the seeds of even greater graft and corruption irregular expenditure has risen 40% in the past two years are sown. It is time for the perpetrators to be publicly named, tried and jailed.
