The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) decided not to participate in the question-and-answer session in parliament on Wednesday. The party says that it doesn&#8217;t recognise President Jacob Zuma as president, and that participating in the parliamentary session would amount to &#8220;legitimising&#8221; Zuma, whom they call a fugitive. &#8220;After the declaration from the highest court in the land that Zuma has violated the constitution, it is immoral to legitimise and normalise a fugitive by participating in a question and answer session,&#8221; said the party&#8217;s national spokesperson, Mbuyiseni Ndlozi. The EFF cited the Constitutional Court judgment against Zuma as one of the reasons why they would not participate. The Constitutional Court found that the president had violated his oath of office in relation to how he handled the Nkandla matter. &#8220;Jacob Zuma was found by the Constitutional Court to have violated his oath of office, and thereby undermining the constitution, in that he failed to uphold and protect it. Zuma failed to do this in relation to the processes of the upgrade of his private home in Nkandla where he unduly benefited from the abuse and misuse of state funds. &#8220;The State of Capture report has also found that Jacob Zuma is continuing to violate the Code of Ethics in his business dealings with the Gupta family. As a matter of fact, Zuma has allowed the country to be led politically by the Gupta family, which South Africans did not vote for. It is beyond any doubt that Zuma is at the centre of a Gupta criminal syndicate and they have turned South Africa into a kleptocracy. Zuma is in the middle of rapacious and callous looting of state resources for his own benefits.&#8221; The president recently confessed to knowing &#8220;people who are stealing&#8221; in government, but that he would not mention their names as yet. The EFF has said that his knowing about such alleged crimes and not reporting them makes Zuma complicit in them. &#8220;Zuma has recently admitted that he knows who else is stealing South Africa&#8217;s money through corruption and he has not reported it. Keeping silent on corruption makes one party to the corruption being committed, so Zuma has publicly admitted to a criminal offence and is therefore a criminal. &#8220;After the declaration from the highest court in the land that Zuma has violated the constitution, it is immoral to legitimise and normalise a fugitive by participating in a Question and Answer session. &#8220;We refuse to normalise him, and reject the hypocrisy and failure of parliament to think Zuma can comply and answer about the country when he has been declared in the highest court in the land to be in violation of the law of the land. Zuma is a fugitive and the entire continuation with him in all sessions, whether symbolic or real, as if he is normal, will not help change the situation.&#8221;
