Two male construction workers were critically injured Tuesday morning after an apparent structural collapse at a building site at the corner of West and Rivonia streets in Sandton. ER24 said when paramedics and fire services arrived they found out that two men had fallen through scaffolding. Paramedics immediately assessed both men and found that they were in a critical condition, having sustained numerous injuries. &#8220;Fire services began to evacuate the construction site while paramedics treated the patients and provided them with numerous advanced life support interventions, said Russel Meiring, ER24 spokesperson. The patients were transported to a nearby private hospital for urgent treatment. The cause of the collapse was being investigated by local authorities.
