A flash flood on the N3 in Linksfield, in the northeast of Johannesburg, on Wednesday afternoon affected more than 100 cars, with more than 10 cars pushed off the highway, down an embankment and submerged in water. Emer-G-Med paramedics are attending to the scene and spokesperson Max Cohen said at this stage it is believed that one person drowned. By 9pm, Cohen said paramedics and rescue officials found a second drowning victim during search and rescue operations on the N3 in Linksfield. &#8220;Emer-G-Med paramedics are attending to multiple patients with minor injuries,&#8221; he said, and urged motorists to avoid the area and that the highway would be closed for some time.
