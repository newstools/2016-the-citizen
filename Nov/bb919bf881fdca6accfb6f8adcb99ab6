President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s wife Nompumelelo &#8220;MaNtuli&#8221; Zuma is officially a suspect in an attempted murder case against her husband, according to documents the Sunday Times reports it has seen. It says that National Director of Public Prosecutions Shaun Abrahams wrote to MaNtuli&#8217;s lawyer last month to say that she had been identified as &#8220;one of the suspects [in the alleged conspiracy to murder Zuma]&#8221;. Her lawyer, Ulrich Roux, reportedly confirmed to the paper that his client was charged with attempted murder in April last year, but the case went completely quiet after that, with neither the Hawks nor the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) taking further action. He said that his client&#8217;s constitutional rights were thus being trampled on. MaNtuli continues to deny that she tried to poison her husband. According to tabloid newspaper Sunday Sun last week, Zuma and MaNtuli had rekindled their romance after her eviction from Nkandla by State Security Minister David Mahlobo, allegedly as a result of the poisoning attempt, which reportedly was confirmed to a then sickly looking Number 1 by both US and Russian doctors. A traditional expert speaking to the paper said she needed to perform a ritual called inhlawulo to apologise. According to the paper, the First Lady has been staying near Greytown in KwaZulu-Natal as the guest of &#8220;a top ANC politician&#8221;. Zuma&#8217;s wife is &#8216;homeless&#8217; report The gossip has apparently been that she&#8217;s been selling imported clothing from China to get by. This week, one of her family members said she was training to become a pastor and was hoping to reconcile with her husband. The paper was unable to get comment on the matter from either the presidency, Zuma&#8217;s family or MaNtuli herself. The paper also mentioned that she had to buy Zuma a goat in 2010 to apologise for &#8220;bad behaviour&#8221; after she was reportedly unhappy at the time about her husband taking yet another wife, Gloria Bongekile Ngema. Roux, however, denied reports that his client was returning to Nkandla despite the family&#8217;s attempts to &#8220;normalise&#8221; the relationship.
