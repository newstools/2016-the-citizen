Dar es Salaam. Despite the government s emphasis on commercial agriculture, the majority of youth in Tanzania lack the financial clout to invest in the sector.Not eligible for loans as they lack collateral, the problem is further compounded by the red tape one has to cut through for setting up an agriculture project. Engaging youth in agriculture has become a grave concern as young people have become disenchanted with farming.In a bid to empower Tanzania youth in commercial agriculture by the ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries together with Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) jointly launched the five-year National Strategy for Youth Involvement in Agriculture (NSYIA) 2016/21.FAO assistant representative Charles Tulahi said FAO will work closely with the government in documenting and up-scaling interventions for youth, support country-specific research on the employment situation and available job opportunities in the agricultural sector.He said, support through appropriate policies, strategies and programmes are necessary to boost youth engagement in agriculture. The country s current youth population is 60 per cent, this would likely increase in the near future as more than 80 per cent of the world s 1.2 billion youth live in developing countries, he said.He noted that, available information indicates that, while the world s youth population will continue to grow, employment and entrepreneurial opportunities for young women and men will remain limited, particularly for those living in rural areas in developing countries.He said addressing youth issues has a very significant positive impact in reducing poverty, hunger and malnutrition. Supporting the youth could increase social stability and rejuvenation of the agricultural sector.According to him, Tanzania and Africa in general, have youthful populations, whose energy and talents have to be harnessed to transform the agricultural sector and livelihoods of rural communities.He stressed that encouraging youth in agriculture would help in attaining targets for the Sustainable Development Goals particularly the ones aimed at achieving sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all.Permanent Secretary in the Agriculture ministry Florens Turuka said strategy will facilitate youth in land acquisition. We encourage youth to form groups so that they work as teams on agricultural projects, he said.Mr Turuka said for the strategy to succeed agriculture stakeholders must come together. About 67 per cent of the youth are currently involved in informal agriculture which does not does not bring in handsome returns and does not contribute towards the Gross Domestic Product (GDP, he said.The growing youth population (60 per cent of Africans are between 16-24 years of age) do not see agriculture as a profitable opportunity, but rather, regard it as subsistence farming, or a dead end.To engage youth in agriculture, steps need to be taken to facilitate easy access to secure financial services. Young people need the right skills to grow their own businesses as agriculture offers several pathways to steady employment or entrepreneurship. On-the-job training and coaching towards employment or self-employment are essential.Despite the decline in interest for agriculture as a career there are young farmers working all over the world.According to experts farming offers the young generation a chance to make a difference by growing food to feed the world. Those who become farmers have the opportunity to be the generation that will end world hunger and alleviate malnutrition, as well as help the sector adapt to climate change.Experts believe that increased use of mobile phones in farming could help deter young people away from stereotypes of traditional farming and help change their perceptions on agriculture, helping them to view it as an exciting and innovative industry.There are many challenges ahead for the sector but if young people are offered education in agriculture, a voice at policy level, and in the media, and are engaged with innovations then the agriculture industry can attract youth again.
