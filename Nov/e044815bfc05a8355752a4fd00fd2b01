by Tom WILLIAMS Mourinho hit out after Smalling and Shaw missed United&#8217;s 3-1 win at Swansea City on Sunday, making a distinction between &#8220;the brave&#8221; and &#8220;the ones for whom a little pain can make a difference&#8221;. But Southgate, who left both players out of his squad for England&#8217;s games against Scotland and Spain, said the defenders would not have missed the United game unless they felt unable to play. &#8220;They didn&#8217;t play, so there&#8217;s a medical issue,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Chris hasn&#8217;t played for the last four games. &#8220;We have really good relationships, medical-to-medical, with all clubs. I&#8217;ve got great trust in our medical team that they&#8217;ll make the right calls. &#8220;Obviously it&#8217;s a difficult one because I don&#8217;t know the reason for the comments Jose&#8217;s made.&#8221; Smalling has missed United&#8217;s last four games with a foot problem, while Shaw has endured niggling injuries since making his comeback from a double leg fracture sustained in September 2015. On Shaw, Southgate said: &#8220;If he wasn&#8217;t fit to play yesterday (Sunday) &#8212; and he was with us in September under (former England manager) Sam (Allardyce) and was feeling problems with the leg &#8212; there&#8217;s clearly something. &#8220;After an injury as severe as that, we&#8217;ve got to handle that with care as well. It&#8217;s a difficult balance to find. But that&#8217;s where we have to trust our medical teams. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s so difficult with any player. Every injury is different, every individual is different. &#8220;I&#8217;ve not known players not play unless there&#8217;s something. Having been a player, that would be my view on it.&#8221; England tackle old rivals Scotland in a World Cup qualifier at Wembley on Friday before bringing the curtain down on 2016 with a home friendly against Spain the following Tuesday. &#8211; Gazza goes fishing &#8211; Southgate, placed in temporary charge after Allardyce was brought down by a newspaper sting, was a member of the England team that overcame Scotland 2-0 in a group-stage match at Euro 96. The game at Wembley was illuminated by a famous goal from Paul &#8216;Gazza&#8217; Gascoigne, who lifted the ball over Scotland centre-back Colin Hendry&#8217;s head before volleying home. Gascoigne, England&#8217;s midfield talisman at the time, was a bundle of nervous energy and Southgate revealed the lengths that were taken to calm him down before kick-off. &#8220;(England coach) Bryan Robson made him a fishing rod and he was pretend fishing in the bath at Wembley,&#8221; Southgate told journalists at England&#8217;s St George&#8217;s Park base in Burton-on-Trent, central England. &#8220;Because that was the only time he ever relaxed. Make of that what you will! &#8220;They created (a fishing rod) out of the medical skip. To calm him down, basically. &#8220;He used to go with (goalkeeper) David Seaman during the week in the afternoon just to get himself out of everybody&#8217;s hair for a couple of hours. He found that the most relaxing thing.&#8221; While the England-Scotland fixture no longer resonates as widely as it once did, Southgate is eager to impress the historical significance of the rivalry upon his players. &#8220;It&#8217;s the oldest international fixture. The rivalry is obvious, the history between the two countries is obvious,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We could build it up to be as big as we want. For us it&#8217;s a game of football that is going to help us qualify for a World Cup. That is the key. &#8220;But we should embrace the emotion of the occasion. That&#8217;s what sport is about. &#8220;Because every time you play for England, you have a chance to make some history, or to play in a game that people will remember forever, and that&#8217;s incredibly powerful.&#8221;
