Sport and Recreation Minister Fikile Mbalula has labelled African National Congress (ANC) secretary-general Gwede Mantashe a &#8220;snitch&#8221;, accusing him of colluding with the opposition. Mbalula reportedly made the statement to pro-President Jacob Zuma ANC members, including SAA chairperson Dudu Myeni, in a WhatsApp group allegedly coordinated by Zuma&#8217;s son Edward. In a series of messages, the sports minister said he had lost respect for Mantashe, further saying the ruling party did not need leaders like him, reports City Press. In the group, only Mbalula and Winston Innes, the Managing Director of Blackcap Petroleum, could be seen discussing the matter, which explains why the messages have found their way to the public. &#8220;It&#8217;s sad to see our heroes reduce themselves to the &#8216;house negro&#8217; who does his master&#8217;s bidding. One would have thought these would be people with a higher moral fibre than most especially having lived under an oppressive regime,&#8221; said Winston Innes. &#8220;Let&#8217;s say maybe he was expressing his fears but how do you ask to do this. People who are not ANC members. My SG has seriously lowered the guard and compromised the standing of that office. &#8220;This is more than snitching.. he must come out clean,&#8221; said Mbalula. &#8220;Comrade Fikile you can&#8217;t ask a snake why he bit you, it&#8217;s who he is. You&#8217;ve got to deal with that snake accordingly,&#8221; said Winston. &#8220;First he was sent to discuss coalitions; he then even weakened the ANC further,&#8221; added Mbalula. Malema exposed Gwede badly. Snitch, he further said.

The sports minister has denied it&#8217;s him in the WhatsApp messages but City Press reported that it had confirmed it was his phone number. Mantashe has flatly denied the allegations, whereas Malema stands by what he told Madonsela. Malema made the revelations under oath in an interview with then public protector Thuli Madonsela. She was interviewing Malema as part of her investigations for the &#8220;State of Capture&#8221; report, which implicates the Gupta family, Zuma and other senior government and parastatal officials in possible corruption. In the recording, the last bit of discussion around the circumstances of how the Guptas wanted their own helipad in Saxonwold can be heard. She then asks Malema for his thoughts on why he said in the media that the nuclear deal was only being pushed as hard as it is because the Gupta family owns a uranium mine and allegedly stands to benefit from the nuclear build programme.
