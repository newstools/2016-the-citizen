Miss SA Ntandoyenkosi Kunene&#8217;s Miss World dress has been revealed, and South Africans are not impressed with it. JJ Schoeman designed the dress and called it &#8220;traditional&#8221; and was apparently inspired by the Mpumalanga sun. Miss South Africa called it &#8220;a work of art&#8221;, while Cell C South Africa said Kunene was flaunting her &#8220;magnificent&#8221; dress. But it&#8217;s those descriptions that have rubbed Twitter off the wrong way, as most said there was nothing traditional about the dress. Actor Florence Masebe is just not impressed with the dress. How is it a work of art? Where is it traditional? Is it magnificent? she asked her followers on the social media platform. &#8220;JJ Schoeman took an orange sack and threw it over Ntando Kunene and the Miss SA people say it&#8217;s a work of art. Ba re ke [They say it&#8217;s a] traditional dress,&#8221; she said. JJ Schoeman took an orange sack and threw it over Ntando Kunene and the #MissSA people say it&#39;s a work of art.
