There was not much between Palladium and My Pal Al when they met on the grass at Scottsville recently over 1400m and there should not be much between them again in Race 8, the KZN 3YO Series 1600 9 Non-Black Type) over 1600m at Greyville Polytrack today. My Pal Al has won on the surface and was a long head in front of Palladium that day but I am expecting Anton Marcus on Palladium to overturn that deficit over this longer distance. Trainer Charles Laird has his yard in tip-top shape and his charge Palladium won his first two starts. Tackling feature-race company in his next four starts only provided a couple of good third place finishes for the Silvano colt. Palladium is well drawn. The best bet on the card could be Je Suis Silver in Race 4, a Maiden Plate over 1000m. This Curved Ball filly is improving and was only caught very late last time out. Marcus takes over from the 4kg-claiming apprentice who rode her that day and this course and distance clearly suits the three-year-old filly. The other runner who may be worth looking at is Greatfiveeight in Race 7. Blinkers were reached for on Greatfiveeight last time out and it did its trick and the five-point penalty he received for that win may not be enough to stop a follow up win. &nbsp;
