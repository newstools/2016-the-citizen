Pulp Fiction star Samuel L Jackson is to join the cast of Oscar-winning actress Brie Larson s directorial debut Unicorn Store, producer Rhea Films announced. Jackson, nominated for an Academy Award and four Golden Globes over a 44-year acting career, will play opposite Joan Cusack and Bradley Whitford. Based on an original script by Samantha McIntyre, Unicorn Store centres on a woman who moves back in with her parents and receives an invitation to a store that will test her ideas of what it really means to grow up. The comedy just began principal photography in Los Angeles. Larson, who won her best actress Oscar in February for Lenny Abrahamson s Room, worked with Jackson on Kong: Skull Island, due to release in March. Cusack, who was Oscar-nominated for Working Girl (1988) and won an Emmy in 2015 for Showtime s Shameless, will next be seen in A Series of Unfortunate Events.
