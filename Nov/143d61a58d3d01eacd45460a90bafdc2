Kibo Mining said on Monday it had signed a collaboration agreement with digital industrial giant General Electric (GE) with respect to the development of the Mbeya Coal to Power Project. Kibo is on the brink of developing a 250 to 350 megawatt mouth-of-mine thermal power station, the Mbeya Coal To Power Project (MCPP), in southwestern Tanzania. The agreement provides for GE and its affiliate companies to supply equipment, technology and services to the MCPP power plant and helping Kibo to implement the project. Kibo Mining chief executive Louis Coetzee said the two companies had collaborated closely on progressing development work on the MCPP since the signing of a memorandum of understanding in September. As one of the largest and technologically advanced international companies, we are looking forward to growing this relationship, Coetzee said. By working closely with GE, we will benefit from their experience and reputation, and this will expedite the remaining work required to reach successful financial close on the MCPP. George Njenga, GE s steam power systems sales executive for Africa, said they were delighted to partner with Kibo for the Mbeya power project.
