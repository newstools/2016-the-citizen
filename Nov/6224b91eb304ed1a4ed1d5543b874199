Zaha, 24, was born in Abidjan but appeared in two friendlies for England under former Three Lions&#8217; boss Roy Hodgson, making his debut against Sweden in November 2012. The FIF said Zaha had passed on his decision after several weeks of contact with the player and had personally informed FIF president Augustin Sidy Diallo and &#8216;Elephants&#8217; coach Michel Dussuyer of his switch. Zaha, who moved to England as a small child, joined the Palace academy aged 12 and had a short spell with Manchester United, has also informed world governing body Fifa of his decision.
