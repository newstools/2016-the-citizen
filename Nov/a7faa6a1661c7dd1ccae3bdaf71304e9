A 19-year-old girl went missing after a wave reportedly washed her into the sea at Blythedale Beach in Durban. Witnesses contacted KwaDukuza lifeguards and IPSS Medical Rescue for help on Thursday. Three matriculant girls from Mandeni were celebrating the end of exams and were taking photos of each other on the shore-break when a wave washed one of the girls into the sea, and she disappeared, said KwaDukuza lifeguard supervisor Bongani Xulu. IPSS Medical Rescue s Paul Herbst said: My lifeguards had finished for the day and were on their way home when they received the call. They turned around and headed to Blythedale Beach and contacted me, and I immediately responded. Rescue swimmers and jetskis were launched with lifeguards and the IPSS Medical Rescue aquatic unit, who searched tirelessly for the woman. said IPSS Medical Rescue s Paul Herbst. Xulu said: We only had about an hour of daylight left to look for her. The search was suspended owing to poor weather conditions and will resume at first light, North Coast Courier reported. Xulu said the drowning was similar to the one at Zimbali last year. This is so tragic. We try our best to caution people about the dangers of the sea, Xulu said. Swimmers are urged to only swim when lifeguards are on duty and in designated swimming areas. &#8211; Caxton News Service
