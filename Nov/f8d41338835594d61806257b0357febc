by Justin DAVIS Chinese-owned Inter wielded the axe when they sacked Frank de Boer after just 11 games, and Pioli has the toughest of assignments in what will be a cauldron atmosphere at the San Siro stadium. The ex-Lazio boss looks set to revamp Inter&#8217;s line-up for what he has called a &#8220;crucial&#8221; game as they bid to rise from their current ninth position in Serie A, 13 points off leaders Juventus. &#8220;It&#8217;s a crucial game for us. Milan are doing well, but we&#8217;ll go into it with confidence,&#8221; Pioli said. One option for Pioli is to deploy a 4-3-3 with Argentine striker Mauro Icardi, who has hit a league-tying 10 goals in 12 appearances, flanked by Antonio Candreva and Argentina&#8217;s Ever Banega. &#8220;It will be a crucial match for us, because we need to win it,&#8221; said Inter&#8217;s Joao Mario, who helped Portugal beat France in July&#8217;s Euro 2016 final. &#8220;Obviously, I can&#8217;t compare it to the final we played against France at Euro 2016, but in a sense it&#8217;s like a major tournament final &#8212; and we want to win it for the fans.&#8221; Meanwhile AC Milan will hope to brush aside Carlos Bacca&#8217;s goal drought and defender Alessandro Romagnoli&#8217;s injury and keep up their title charge. The seven-time European champions are finally back in contention after years of mediocrity, although Colombia striker Bacca has failed to score in their last five league outings and Romagnoli&#8217;s absence is a key concern. Yet the setbacks have not stopped Vincenzo Montella&#8217;s youthful Rossoneri side giving leaders Juventus a run for their money. &#8211; Totti hip knock &#8211; Milan&#8217;s purple patch, which includes one defeat in their last nine games, has left them just five points off the top in a run which has won plaudits. &#8220;Milan are doing much better than they have been, they have a lot of young players who understand how to play football and as a result the games are great to watch,&#8221; former Milan midfielder Ruud Gullit told Gazzetta dello Sport. Milan&#8217;s hopes of securing a place in European competition next season were boosted by a 1-0 home win over Juventus at the San Siro last month. And midfielder Andrea Poli told Milan Channel: &#8220;We&#8217;ve really been working hard these past few days, the derby is very important to us, and our fans. &#8220;It&#8217;s another big test for us after beating Juventus, but Inter haven&#8217;t been doing great lately and they will be determined to get back on the right track. &#8220;We&#8217;ll keep our feet on the ground, but we have to be conscious we&#8217;re doing really well.&#8221; Roma, in second place, travel to Atalanta without veteran playmaker Francesco Totti, who was set to start from the bench before suffering a knock to his hip. Mohamed Salah&#8217;s maiden league hat-trick in a 3-0 win over Bologna a fortnight ago ensures the Egyptian will line up alongside Radja Nainggolan and Diego Perotti in Roma&#8217;s midfield. It leaves Bosnia international Edin Dzeko as the lone striker, but in prime position to add to the league-leading goal tally he shares with Icardi. Elsewhere, fourth-placed Lazio host Genoa hoping to close the gap on Milan, while sixth-placed Napoli travel to Udinese with one eye on Wednesday&#8217;s Champions League clash at home to Dinamo Kiev. Juventus are in a similar position, and coach Massimiliano Allegri will be forced to dig deep into his injury-depleted squad ahead of Saturday&#8217;s home game with struggling Pescara to keep legs fresh for Tuesday&#8217;s trip to Sevilla.
