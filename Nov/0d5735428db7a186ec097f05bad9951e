After a protracted debate that took place over several hours, the National Assembly finally voted on whether it still had confidence in President Jacob Zuma. The fifth motion of no confidence against the president since 2012 came as the ruling party was trying to contain the fallout from adverse findings in former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela s report State of Capture. Madonsela found that Zuma may have flouted the Executive Ethics Members Act by failing to act on indications that the State was benefiting the business dealings of the Gupta family. After deputy speaker Lechesa Tsenoli took a verbal vote, he immediately announced that &#8220;the no&#8217;s have it&#8221;, after which the DA asked for a division, meaning people would have to arrange themselves into groups to be counted according to their vote. The EFF&#8217;s Floyd Shivambu immediately tried to push once more for the ballot to be secret because &#8220;the Guptas would call&#8221; ANC MPs to their house to harass them if they voted against Zuma. He later said that he was confident Zuma could be removed if voting was secret. Tsenoli was, however, not moved. Minister of Science and Technology Naledi Pandor moved to have the division take place according to the rules of the House. Tsenoli then decided that the chief whips of the parties could decide in the open forum on the matter of a secret ballot. ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu then endorsed a high court decision that ruled that motions of no confidence in the president would not have to take place by secret ballot, as parliament could decide for itself. He therefore rejected the use of secret ballot, despite the fact that the opposition pointed out the court had also not expressly ruled out the use of secret ballots. Another opposition MP wanted to know why the ANC was &#8220;scared&#8221; of voting by secret ballot. The DA&#8217;s John Steenhuisen attempted to propose a solution by suspending rule 102 to allow for secret voting to take place that would allow those ANC MPs feeling conflicted to vote in secret. Just to add to the circus-like atmosphere, an MP &#8220;needing the loo&#8221; was not allowed to leave because, according to Tsenoli, &#8220;we are in the process of voting&#8221;. The EFF called on Tsenoli to rule on whether the member &#8220;can go to the loo. Can you please open the doors?&#8221; Tsenoli said &#8220;this is an exception &#8230; this is not allowed usually &#8230; this is an exception.&#8221; The ANC charged that the EFF was &#8220;wasting our time&#8221;. Lechesa then said, after calling Steenhuizen &#8220;Oosthuizen&#8221; that voting would proceed as normal and any members who had left to go to the loo could still have their vote counted. Parliament, with the door open, appeared to then be waiting for the MP who&#8217;d gone to the loo to return. Voting finally took place with respective MPs pushing either the &#8220;yes&#8221;, &#8220;no&#8221; or &#8220;abstain&#8221; buttons. The session immediately closed. There was one abstention, 126 yeses, 214 no&#8217;s and 58 members who did not press a button. Tsenoli was immediately accused of having taken too long to read out the results, with opposition MPs saying the results may have been tampered with. Insults and accusations Water and Sanitation Minister had earlier accused the DA of bringing the vote merely to denigrate the the president. She sparked outrage when she called DA leader Mmusi Maimane blackface , prompting the DA to angrily protest the slur. She charged that the DA was using a black face to protect the interests of the white minority , sending DA chief whip John Steenhuisen to his feet. Minister Mokonyane made it clear that Mr Maimane is being used by members of another race here, he complained. ALSO READ: Zuma will kill ANC MPs Shivambu ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu suggested that her statement was not racist or unparliamentary but a matter of debate. Steenhuisen replied: If it is open season on racial profiling in this house now I think it is a very sad day for this house. Mokonyane resumed her speech and said it was clear that the DA, by bringing another motion of no confidence against the president, was seeking to undermine the ruling party s commitment to radical economic transformation. The DA, she continued, aims to keep intact apartheid economic realities&#8221;. She added that the ANC was united on a path of correction and self-renewal . The insults continued to fly, including against Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba, who was accused after his pro-ANC speech by the EFF of having spoken through his stomach and to support his &#8220;concubines&#8221;. Deputy president of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Floyd Shivambu had also earlier made a damning implication that, at the end of the day, when he no longer has anything to lose, President Jacob Zuma would kill all his opponents, which he said included ANC members of parliament (MPs). Shivambu argued that this is what all dictators on the African continent do when they have no other options left. He said the president would resort to killing his political opponents when he was faced with jail. These comments did not sit well with ANC MPs and he was called to withdraw these remarks. He further said now ANC MPs were defending him, but Zuma would kill them when he had nothing left to lose. Shivambu was asked to withdraw his comment when he said Minister of Mineral Resources Mosebenzi Zwane was appointed by the controversial Gupta family. Shivambu said: &#8220;Let me assure you that I will not withdraw the truth. I repeat that all dictators kill their opponents at the end when they have nothing to lose. Now you think he is your friend &#8230; he is going to kill all of you.&#8221; Earlier when the session started, the EFF and the DA argued that the motion of no confidence voting should happen through secret ballot to allow ANC MPs who were afraid of victimisation to cast their ballots privately and without fear. ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu also confirmed that the DA had distributed &#8220;letters&#8221; among ANC members of parliament (MPs) &#8220;to inform them to vote in a particular way&#8221;. &#8220;We are to confirm that the DA is sending letters to members of the ANC so they can vote in a particular way,&#8221; said Mthembu after an ANC MP rose on &#8220;a point of order&#8221;, holding a letter. Shivambu accused ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu of having &#8220;double standards&#8221; when he argued that it was against the rules of parliament to vote through a secret ballot. He argued voting should be done through a secret ballot because ANC members of parliament (MPs) would not openly vote against Zuma because &#8220;of fear of victimisation&#8221;.
