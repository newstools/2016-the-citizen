I found them listening to music on their mobile phones during class hours. I, therefore, urged them to go back to class, he said.He said that they ignored his instruction and one of the group members attacked him and stabbed him on the back with a pair of scissors.While running to avoid further harassment, he said, he fell down and sustained severe injury on his arm.

He, however, assured wananchi, students and teachers that police have beefed up security at the area. We have deployed a police van which will be patrolling along the Igoma streets, especially during the forthcoming festive season, the acting RPC saidHe said plans were underway for police to launch a crackdown on criminal groups in the area. He warned that the law-enforcers would act sternly on criminals.Teachers in the area now live in fear, according to Mr Dominic, who said the attack has affected his performance.He said that the group members have also threaten to attack his wife.Mr Jaralya explained that students have been establishing criminal gangs that are organized in the streets and that they extend their quarrels and attack at the school.He reiterated that the gangs are involved in immorality activities in the streets including playing local gambling games, quarrelling over women and abusing. The quarrels between the gangs arise over disagreement in payment after engaging in gambling games or while fighting over women, he saidBut he said that the school administration has found difficulties in controlling the criminal students because parents have been backing their immorality.For example, he said that when they invite parents at the school to discuss discipline, he said that parents ignore and back the student s immorality. However, he said that most of the students have repeatedly been involved in bad conduct despite warnings from the teachers.But he said that the condition at the school environment where there is no perimeter wall and a gate has been enabling students to sneak in and out of school while armed with weapons.He reiterated that teachers conduct their activities with fear of being attacked by students and it has affected their performances.However, he said that at the day secondary school, teachers are unable to control and monitor immorality in students who their gangs extend threats to teachers who live in the streets.He urged police to intervene and restore conducive learning environment at the school by arresting the culpable students.
