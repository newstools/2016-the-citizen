Less than 4 000 entries remained available for the 2017 Comrades Marathon, organisers revealed on Tuesday, with more than 16 000 people having already committed to the annual ultra-distance race. The entry count thus far included around 5 000 novices and over 1 300 foreign participants. A total of 2 150 &#8216;green number&#8217; runners, who had previously completed the gruelling race at least 10 times, were also among the confirmed entries. &#8220;Prospective Comrades runners are urged to enter before the entry process closes on November 30 or as soon as the 20 000 entry cap is reached,&#8221; the Comrades Marathon Association said in a statement. Runners who had entered the race could submit qualifying details at a later stage. The 87km &#8216;up&#8217; run between Durban and Pietermaritzburg is scheduled to be held on June 4 next year.
