In a very long and intimate Facebook post last week, one of the figures at the forefront of the #FeesMustFall protests, Ntokozo Qwabe, detailed his struggles as a black student and why &#8220;Fees Must Fall for Black Excellence to Rise&#8221;. Qwabe came to public attention for his failed attempt to have Oxford University in England remove a small statue of Cecil John Rhodes from one of its campuses. He was also part of a group that told a white waitress that she couldn&#8217;t get a tip until she returned the land, which drove her to tears. ALSO READ: Helen Zille on Qwabe: &#8216;Oh, the irony!&#8217; Earlier this year, he was also filmed knocking a cellphone out of a white student&#8217;s hand because he did not want himself and his fellow protesters to be filmed disrupting a lecture at the University of Cape Town. In a Facebook post from Wednesday night, he explained that he was busy with his fourth degree and he detailed his many academic successes, including two master&#8217;s degrees and a bachelor of laws summa cum laude. He claimed to have been the top student in all his courses. &#8220;YES, I hold &#8216;the most prestigious scholarship in the world&#8217; (Rhodes), &#8216;the most prestigious scholarship in Afrika&#8217; (Mandela-Rhodes) and &#8216;the most prestigious law degree in the world&#8217; (Bachelor of Civil Law).&#8221; He also listed numerous other accolades and accomplishments, including speaking engagements and various awards. He then, however, explained that he had earlier been forced to drop out of university &#8220;because of fees&#8221;. He complained that after having finished school at the age of 16, he had to go &#8220;into debt with a loan from NSFAS. A loan which, back then, only covered 75% of my tuition fees and no transport, residence, food, books or any other such expenses&#8221;. &#8220;YES, I had to walk for two hours everday [sic] to and from UKZN in order to get to lectures, and would come home too tired to even open a book!&#8221; ALSO READ: Qwabe says he wishes he&#8217;d &#8216;whipped the white bastard&#8217; He then said that he dropped out and had to take a job at Shoprite Checkers, &#8220;first as a trolley boy (yes, those people that push customer trolleys from outside stores), then as a Till Packer (yes, the people who put your items in your bags at the till), and finally as a Cashier (when I had turned 17)&#8221;. He claimed (rather hyperbolically, we imagine) that during his three years of employment, he &#8220;made billions for Shoprite&#8217;s CEO&#8221;. &#8220;YES, for the next three years until June 2010, I made billions of money for the CEO of Shorprite [sic], Whitey Basson (and his cronies), who was recently revealed to be earning millions in salaries and bonuses &#8211; all while I was earning a meagre R1800 per month, and having to save ALL of it so that I could return to university. I know first-hand the exploitation of the black poor at the hands of white capitalism in South Afrika, and that is why I unapologetically champion a student-worker struggle that also seeks to dismantle the exploitative outsourcing of, and payment of poverty wages to, workers on campus.&#8221; He then went into further detail about his quest for self-improvement and the difficulties he and other students continue to face. &#8220;YES, we are in this struggle because black excellence is constantly blocked out by fees. The next time you hear anyone tell you we protest because we do not want to be in class, tell them we actually do want to be in class. We just want to be in a better class. A class that sees our class as black excellent students. A class that is not built to structurally exclude and undermine us. &#8220;YES, my hope is a world where there are no more Ntokozos. No more blacks who have to be a hundred times ultra resilient in order to get to where I have been lucky to. Structural exclusion cannot continue any longer! I was so close to not making it. All those prestigious global awards, degrees, distinctions etc. &#8211; they were nearly all shut out. All that black excellence nearly successfully suppressed at the hands of an unjust system. How can we allow this to continue? &#8220;How can the brightest be kept out by an unjust structure that instists [sic] on commodifying education? How can we possibly expect more excellent 16 year olds to have to expose themselves to indignity in order to have a shot? We can no longer keep out black excellence with fees! Fees must fall for black excellence to flourish!&#8221; You can read his full post in the Facebook embed below.
