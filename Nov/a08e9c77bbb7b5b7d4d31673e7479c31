This after the 26-year-old signed a new three-and-a-half-year contract that will keep him contracted to the Belgian club until 2020. Musona, who has already netted six goals from 13 appearances this season, says he is grateful for the confidence the club has shown in him. I am very pleased with the confidence that I get here, Musona told the KV Oostende website. KVO gave me the chance to prove myself in Europe when it was not really succeeded at Hoffenheim. I feel good here, and I am pleased that I can stay here longer. Musona joined the Belgium side at the beginning of 2015 following his departure from Bundesliga side Hoffenheim.
