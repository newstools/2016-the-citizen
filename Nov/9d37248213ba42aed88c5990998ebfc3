What&#8217;s known is what&#8217;s shown from sunset to sunrise. A foundation built on more than just what is spoken. It&#8217;s commitments kept and promises that go unbroken. An emotion so immense that nothing in this world can erase. The permanent impression of love is tattooed upon her face. A relation so peculiar that only the two can understand, Yet so immaculate it&#8217;s obvious that, by God, it was planned.&#x1f64f;&#x1f49d; A photo posted by Tobeka Madiba Zuma Foundation (@firstladytzuma) on Oct 8, 2016 at 10:42am PDT 5.
