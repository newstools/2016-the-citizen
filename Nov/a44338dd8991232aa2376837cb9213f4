Manchester City-bound teenager Gabriel fired Brazil into the lead with an assured 57th-minute finish. The 19-year-old then set up Brazil&#8217;s second for Augusto in the 78th minute with a superb pass to pick out the 28-year-old China-based midfielder. The victory leaves Brazil four points clear at the top of South America&#8217;s World Cup qualification standings. The Brazilians now have 27 points from 12 games. With six games still remaining, Brazil are all but certain of securing one of the four automatic spots for the 2018 finals in Russia. In qualifiers for the 2014 tournament, a points total of 25 points was good enough to clinch qualification from South America.
