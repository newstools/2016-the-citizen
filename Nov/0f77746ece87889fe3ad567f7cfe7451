Operating theatres at the Polokwane Hospital, excluding the maternity theatre and one for emergencies, have been closed due to a maintenance process as a result of chiller plants being dysfunctional, the Limpopo health department said on Saturday. Service providers were on site and the department had received an indication that they would complete the maintenance process by December 5, the department said in a statement. The department will timeously communicate with the public should there be any delay on the completion date of this process. We have, however, made arrangements that certain procedures be done at the Mankweng, Seshego, and Lebowakgomo hospitals in the interim. Our five regional hospitals are also capacitated to handle certain procedures and our surgeons will be utilising some of these facilities during this period. These hospitals were able to carry out the required procedures as illustrated by the recent intervention made by Dr Steve Matshidza and his team where 30 patients were operated on at Tshilidzini Hospital, a regional hospital over a weekend. We must understand that our facilities are old and from time to time we will be forced to shut down certain divisions in order to perform the necessary maintenance. We appeal to the people of Limpopo to be patient with us during this period and whenever they encounter challenges they must contact their hospital CEO and the clinical managers, the department said.
