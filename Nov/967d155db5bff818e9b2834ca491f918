With only one qualifier from each group, Nigeria landed what most pundits believed to be the toughest, in Group B alongside Algeria, Cameroon and Zambia. Nigeria ensured they remain top of the group and in prime position for Russia with six points from six after Saturday&#8217;s 3-1 home win. &#8220;It&#8217;s still a long way to go but we&#8217;re on the right path,&#8221; said the 63-year-old German Rohr, who posted his third straight win in charge of Nigeria. &#8220;We had a great first half, but the second half was difficult,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We suffered in the second half, but the players were not nervous, they are professional. We played on the counter-attack when it became 2-1 and we got our third goal from a fast break. &#8220;We defended well. We were organised against Riyad Mahrez and Islam Slimani and we largely kept them quiet.&#8221; Rohr praised skipper John Obi Mikel, who has been frozen out at Premier League Chelsea. &#8220;He played like a true leader,&#8221; Rohr said of the midfielder, who crowned a strong display with a goal. &#8220;He commanded the respect of the team, marshalling and putting so much energy into the effort of the team.&#8221;
