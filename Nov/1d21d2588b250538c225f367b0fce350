Sprinter Wayde van Niekerk has begun a year-end global tour, raking in the first of what could become a string of accolades when he was recognised by the Association of National Olympic Committees (Anoc) on Tuesday night. The Free State speedster, who shattered the 400m world record to win gold at the Rio Games in August, was named Male Athlete of the multisport showpiece at the Anoc Awards in Doha. Tennis player Monica Puig of Puerto Rico, who stunned the favourites to win the singles title in Rio, received the women&#8217;s accolade at the gala ceremony. Van Niekerk was also in line for three gongs at the SA Sport Awards in Bloemfontein later this month, as well as men&#8217;s Athlete of the Year at the IAAF Awards in Monaco next month.
