Asthma is a public health problem affecting about 300 million people worldwide. Most of us have heard about this common medical condition. However, many don t understand what triggers asthma attacks.As a chronic (long-term) lung disease, asthma leads to inflammation and narrowing of the airways. Inflammation is body s immune response to remove harmful stimuli like certain irritants or pathogens.The airways are tubes that carry air into and out of your lungs from the nose and mouth. People who have asthma have inflamed airways. The inflammation process causes their airways to swell and makes them very sensitive. These airways tend to react strongly to certain inhaled substances (triggers).When the airways react, the muscles around them tighten and narrow the airways, causing less air to flow into the lungs. The swelling also can worsen, making the airways even narrower. Furthermore, this inflammation process leads to production of more mucus than usual. This chain reaction results in asthma symptoms commonly termed as asthma attack . It may happen with periods of wheezing (a whistling sound when you breathe), chest tightness, shortness of breath, and coughing.The ultimate causes of asthma are not completely understood. The strongest risk factors for developing asthma are a combination of genetic predisposition with environmental exposure to inhaled substances and particles that may provoke allergic reactions or irritate the airways, such as house dust, mites in bedding, carpets and stuffed furniture and pet dander. It might also include pollens and molds, tobacco smoke and chemical in the workplace.Other triggers can be cold air, extreme emotional arousal such as anger or fear, and physical exercises. Even certain medications can trigger asthma such non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs like diclofenac and beta-blockers (which are used to treat high blood pressure, heart conditions and migraine). The triggers can differ from one person to another.
