Another murder shocked the community of Eersterust after a young man was stabbed to death in the Mamelodi cemetery. Theodore Junies (19) was with his girlfriend when they were attacked by two men who demanded their cellphones. Police spokesperson Warrant Officer Johan Van Byk said the incident happened on Tuesday night as Junies and his girlfriend took a shortcut through the Mamelodi cemetery, east of Pretoria. The couple came across two men in the cemetery who tried to rob them of their cellphones and stabbed the man to death. The suspects fled from the scene, Van Byk said. Junies lived with his grandmother in a house in the back of the Lede in Christus Church. Van Byk said the woman was unharmed but is still in shock. About two weeks ago a 76-year-old woman was stabbed to death in her home in Makena Street in Eersterust. Twin brothers living a house from her and a third suspect were arrested for her murder. They also face a charge of robbery. The police are following up various leads in connection with Junies&#8217; murder and are hoping to make an arrest soon, he said. Junies was a Grade 11 learner at Prosperitus High school and wrote exams yesterday, hours before he was brutally killed. The school is in shock and is devastated by the death.
