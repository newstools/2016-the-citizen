Dar es Salaam. Francis SMG Cheka faces an Indian test in a World Boxing Organisation (WBO) Super Middleweight Asia Pacific title bout scheduled for December 17 against Vijender Singh.The fight is billed to take place at the Thyagaraj Stadium in New Delhi, India, and has been organised by two promoters, Neerav Tomar of the IOS Promotions and Frank Warren of Queensberry Promotions. The matchmaker is Mike Altamura. Speaking with The Citizen, an upbeat Cheka said he was ready to fight.The 34-year-old Tanzanian professional boxer has had 43 fights, 32 wins (including 17 knockouts) and has tested himself against top super-middleweight talent, including WBA world champion Fedor Chudinov from Russia and WBC international Champion Matthew Mecklin from UK.Cheka has racked up 300 grueling rounds under his belt in the 16 years of his career compared to Vijender s 27, and has no fear fighting in India.Cheka was formerly a WBF world champion. He currently holds the Intercontinental Super Middleweight Championship title, which he won in February against Serbian Geard Ajetovic.Vijender, on the other hand, is undefeated in his seven-fight career so far. Cheka is Vijender s most experienced opponent to date and will prove a stern test for the big-hitting Indian boxer. Vijender currently has a record of seven out of seven wins including 6 knockouts. Vijender claimed his first title at the Thyagaraj Stadium in July this year against Australian Kerry Hope.On fighting Cheka, Vijender said, Cheka is a highly experienced boxer, he has many bouts under his belt, but none of this demotivates me. I am training harder to match up to his level and hoping for another win. Once again my fight will be at home, the support that I get from the crowd is overwhelming.
