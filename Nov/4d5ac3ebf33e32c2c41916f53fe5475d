Trade union Solidarity on Friday accused the South African Police Service of discriminating against its workers based on their gender and race and of not caring about legitimate grievances of these employees. This followed what Solidarity said was a no-show by SAPS at a conciliation session scheduled at the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) for over 200 police members which the union claims have been prejudiced.

She said this was because they either did not belong to the right race or the right gender . Barnard said: It is totally ridiculous that the SAPS is discriminating against these hardworking members of the Service on the basis of their race and gender. Solidarity vowed not to leave the matter and said it would pursue it until justice prevailed. &#8211; African News Agency
