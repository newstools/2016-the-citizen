Allow to boil until reduced by half. 2 For the trout kebabs, soak the kebab sticks in water if you are using wooden ones. Cut the trout into nice chunks and marinate in the glaze, 30 minutes. Thread the chunks onto the kebab sticks. Fry them in a pan over high heat, turning them every minute, to sear, about 5 minutes in total (do not overcook them). Remove from heat and brush with the glaze as you take them out of the pan. 3 For the bok choi, place the bok choi and olive oil in the same pan in which you cooked the trout and season to taste. Finish off with a squeeze of lemon juice and garnish with the spring onions.
