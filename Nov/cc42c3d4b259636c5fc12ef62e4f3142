StatsSA said though the number of employed people increased by 288 000, the growth in employment was offset by an increase in unemployment of 239 000, resulting in a rise of 0.5 of a percentage point in the unemployment rate. Discouraged job seekers accounted for two-thirds of the increase among the non-economically active population. On a quarterly basis, StatsSA said employment only increased in the formal and informal sectors as well as in agriculture. &#8211; African News Agency
