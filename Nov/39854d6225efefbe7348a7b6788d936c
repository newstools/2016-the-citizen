President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s astonishing statements in a televised speech on Friday afternoon have continued to cause uproar and debate, after he appeared to admit to having knowledge of who is stealing from the public purse but instead of doing anything about it, he told the crowd that he was &#8220;just watching them. I know them.&#8221; He was speaking mainly in isiZulu at an ANC cadres&#8217; forum in Pietermaritzburg on Friday night, where he attempted to deflect from accusations of his own alleged theft and corruption by saying that &#8220;they have investigated me all over but they are finding nothing because I&#8217;m not doing anything&#8221;. He failed to mention that he has spent the past decade avoiding 783 charges of corruption. DA leader Mmusi Maimane told the Sunday Times that Zuma&#8217;s boasts about failing to act against corrupt and criminal activities were &#8220;embarrassing&#8221;. ALSO READ: Zuma has confessed to his guilt Mpofu He said Zuma was &#8220;spitting on the constitution&#8221; and added that he would take up the matter with the Hawks this week when he went to discuss the criminal charges he had laid against Zuma on Tuesday. Maimane said that the people Zuma was talking about were part of &#8220;his faction&#8221;, though it&#8217;s far more likely that Zuma was trying to cast aspersions on his enemies, both within the ANC and outside the party. However, he may not have factored in his constitutional obligations while making his off-the-cuff remarks. The EFF&#8217;s advocate Dali Mpofu took to Twitter after the speech to say that Zuma had, in effect, confessed to breaking the executive ethics code the very thing he stands accused of doing in relation to his friends the Guptas and their alleged attempt to influence Cabinet appointments. Advocate Paul Hoffman of the Institute for Accountability in Southern Africa told the Sunday Times that Zuma&#8217;s speech had showcased his total lack of understanding of the constitution. He said Zuma had a &#8220;complete lack of insight into the duties and responsibilities of a president in our constitutional dispensation&#8221;.
