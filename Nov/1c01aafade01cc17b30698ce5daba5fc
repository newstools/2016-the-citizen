One of the participants at the Old Mutual Soweto Marathon died during the 21km race on Sunday, organisers have confirmed. &#8220;We have been told about the passing of one of the athletes in the half-marathon,&#8221; Sello Khunou, chairperson of the Soweto Marathon Trust, said on Monday. No further details were available, and the organisers were waiting for the official medical report to be submitted by the race doctor and medical services personnel on duty at the event. The annual road race, which consisted of 42km, 21km and 10km distances, attracted 25 000 entrants. While the race started in cool, overcast weather, temperatures soared during the day, and most runners finished in warm conditions. According to a Daily Sun report, the participant was 65-year-old Hendrik Matthys from the Northern Cape, who collapsed two kilometres from the finish at FNB Stadium.
