A motion of no confidence was tabled against president Jacob Zuma at an NEC meeting and will be discussed again today, City Press reports. Tourism minister Derek Hanekom is said to have broken ranks with Zuma&#8217;s backers when he filed the motion, which is further set to show the deep divisions that exist in the ruling party. A discussion around a vote will be held today as several key NEC members were unavailable. City Press further reports the decision to hear the motion of no confidence comes after party stalwarts convinced the national working committee to host a policy conference next June. &#8220;There was a lot of lobbying even at lunch. The issue is that people can&#8217;t defend the indefensible. A lot of people didn&#8217;t attend, but some left because they didn&#8217;t want to be accused of having been a part of the cabal that removed Zuma. They didnt want to nail their colours to the mast,&#8221; said an ANC leader.

The state capture report was distributed to attendants and the ANC secretary-general confirmed this, adding that it was a talking point. The report is said to be used as a basis for Hanekom and other ANC leaders intention to prove that Zuma is an unfit leader.
