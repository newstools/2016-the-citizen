The International Cricket Council (ICC) need to take a long and hard look at themselves. On Friday the cricket body voiced disappointment that South African cricket captain Faf du Plessis would appeal his conviction for ball-tampering. Really? Du Plessis reputation is on the line. If he feels he did no wrong, of course he is going to fight the decision. Du Plessis, who was fined his match fee after being caught on camera sucking a sweet, or mint, and rubbing the ball with his saliva during last week s second Test against Australia, pleaded not guilty.

Cricket South Africa chief executive Haroon Lorgat said that Du Plessis decision to appeal was made after he and his legal team studied the written reasons provided by the match referee . In his mind Faf is clear that he did not alter the condition of the ball nor did he intend to do so and that the match referee was not correct to find him guilty, Lorgat added. He is understandably feeling aggrieved. Ball-tampering is a serious offence. The ICC should respect an individual s right to try to clear their name, not slate it. That s why processes are put in place.
