Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula took to Twitter on Sunday morning to send a visual response to his detractors on social media. The sports minister had a tough time of it from some rugby fans who laid the blame for the Springboks&#8217; dismal failures in their ongoing end-of-year tour at his feet. The Boks have apologised to the nation after losing to lowly Italy, a team that had not even come close to beating them on 12 previous occasions, but defeated the Springboks 20-18 on Saturday in Florence. Mbalula had earlier tweeted coach Allister Coetzee the reminder that he would &#8220;need a lot of prayers&#8221;. Coach you are going to need a lot of prayers &#8211; Remember Coach Allister what I told you on your appointment. @Springboks pic.twitter.com/AJPmAZkqUP &mdash; RSA Min of Sport (@MbalulaFikile) November 17, 2016 To add to Mbalula&#8217;s woes, City Press reported on Sunday morning that Mbalula had been sending angry messages to a pro-Zuma WhatsApp group in which he called ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe &#8220;a snitch&#8221;. The group&#8217;s members include SAA chairperson Dudu Myeni and is coordinated by President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s eldest son, Edward. Mbalula is apparently the only ANC national executive committee member in the group, and its most active participant. Mbalula reportedly told people in the group that Mantashe was far too close to the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) for comfort. City Press quoted him as saying on WhatsApp: &#8220;I have always held the view that there are some among us who are debriefing the EFF.&#8221; He also complained that Mantashe had lowered his guard and compromised his office. He was reacting to news last week that EFF leader Julius Malema told public protector Thuli Madonsela that Mantashe had approached the EFF to ask them to oppose the nuclear build deal as part of their demands for coalitions in metros following the August 3 elections. They had also been demanding the resignation of Zuma. Mantashe last week denied that he&#8217;d asked for any favours from the EFF, but Mbalula appears not to have believed him. He told the WhatsApp group that Mantashe was &#8220;snitching&#8221;. Another participant in the group told him that Mantashe was a &#8220;snake&#8221; that needed to be &#8220;dealt with accordingly&#8221;. Mbalula was apparently also aggrieved at other ANC NEC members who have been speaking out openly against Zuma. He denied being part of the WhatsApp group when City Press contacted him. Some on Twitter said that the sports minister may be in for a disciplining for his comments. @GwedeUncle Aren&#39;t you worried about Mbalula is utterance calling a snitch SG,I hope disciplinary hearing coming for also like fransman &mdash; Raymond Baloyi (@RaymondBaloyi4) November 20, 2016 Another claimed that if anyone was actually a snitch working with the EFF, then it was Mbalula himself: Mbalula knows that he has always fed the EFF with ANC info and the public is aware of that&#8230;now he sees an opportunity and exploits it&#8230; https://t.co/ckkCTulade &mdash; Tee Tea (@thatomolorane) November 20, 2016 Wonder if Mbalula will resort to the &quot;my phone was hacked defense&quot;&#8230;ANC certainly seems to be feasting on itself from within &mdash; Ravikumaran Govender (@justravi) November 20, 2016 What was Mbaks&#8217; response to all of this? A simple tweet telling &#8220;Sunday Twitter&#8221; that it needs to be cleansed with Jeyes Fluid, a very strong disinfectant.
