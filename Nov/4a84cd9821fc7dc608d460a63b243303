A warrant was authorised on Wednesday for the arrest of former Proteas cricketer Thami Tsolekile for his failure to appear in court on a charge of assault. He was scheduled to have appeared in the Goodwood Magistrates Court, before magistrate Sean Lea, but was absent when his case was called by prosecutor Moosa Adonis. At the request of defence advocate Mafu Masina, the execution of the arrest warrant was stayed until January 20. If he fails again to appear in court in January, the warrant will forthwith be executed, and he will be brought to court under arrest. At his previous appearance on October 24, the case was postponed to Wednesday for the outcome of written representations that were to be made to the Western Cape Directorate for Public Prosecutions for the withdrawal of the charge. There was no indication at Wednesday s proceedings of what the result of the representations was. Tsolekile, 35, of the Cape Town suburb of Pinelands, was arrested on September 8. He has since appeared in court three times, and Wednesday s appearance would have been his fourth. The prosecutor alleges that he grabbed a teenage boy by the chest and slapped him in the face. The boy was part of a group of children allegedly shouting and throwing stones at passing cars. -African News Agency (ANA)
