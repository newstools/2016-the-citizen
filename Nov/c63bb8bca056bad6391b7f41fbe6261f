Orlando Pirates will hope for some solace at the end of a traumatic week when they host Highlands Park in the Telkom Knockout quarterfinals tonight. Muhsin Ertugral s hasty resignation from the club on Tuesday, after just nine official games in charge, was perhaps inevitable given the manner of the defeat to SuperSport United, a hideous second-half capitulation to lose 6-1. To lose is one thing, to lose like that is entirely another, and if Ertugral s resignation, live on television, upset Pirates chairman Irvin Khoza, it was understandable. In reflection, there were strange goings on at Pirates from the start of the season. What on earth was Ertugral doing selecting goalkeeper Felipe Ovono for Pirates first two games? Then there was the public altercation between Ertugral and defender Edwin Gyimah at Cape Town airport. And then came Tuesday and total collapse in the Nelspruit rain. Ertugral is known as a temperamental coach and perhaps Pirates players were simply not able to handle his disciplinary leadership style. If so, this is more a sad indictment of the players than their coach. Their performance for most of the second half on Tuesday was indicative of a team that had given up. Even with Ertugral gone, there are individuals at Pirates who need to take a long hard look at themselves.
