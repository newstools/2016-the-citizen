The case against University of the Witwatersrand (Wits) former student leader Mcebo Dlamini has been postponed to June 2017 due to an application being launched at the High Court to have his charges dropped. The 30-year-old, who was released on bail last week, faces charges of public violence, theft, malicious damage to property and assault with the intent to cause grievous bodily harm. The alleged crimes were linked to the student protests for free education. During proceedings at the Johannesburg Magistrates&#8217; Court on Tuesday, Dlamini s defence team said the charges were politically motivated . The defence suggested evidence of this was the meeting between President Jacob Zuma and the National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) Shaun Abrahams to discuss the Fees Must Fall protests in the absence of Minister of Higher Education Blade Nzimande and the Minister of Finance Pravin Gordhan. We asked the judge to comment on the conduct of NDPP. The application is still pending, Advocate Tinny Sebuko said. Pending judgement of appeal court on the political interference, there s nothing we can do further. The defence also called for the withdrawal of charges against Dlamini because his rights were infringed upon. University students, who turned up to support Dlamini, filled the court. State prosecutor Steven Rubin said: There are still outstanding investigations, and the state intends on adding evidence. As a result, the magistrate postponed the matter to June 15, 2017. Outside the court, Dlamini said it was up to young people to fight against injustice , which was why he went to Bloemfontein to support Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema on Monday. He added he was in discussions with Wits management to have two sittings for examinations for students who were not ready to write.
