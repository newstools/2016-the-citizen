Dodoma. Youth in three regions in Tanzania will be reached to educate them on how they can take part in implementing sustainable development goals.That will be undertaken in a joint campaign by UN and Fursa in Dodoma, Kigoma and Dar es Salaam.Having received extensive training from the UN on the Global Goals, Fursa will use its platform to conduct awareness-raising seminars in which over 10,000 youth are expected to participate.The aim of the seminars is to increase the youth s understanding of the Global Goals and how to implement them.UN Resident Coordinator Alvaro Rodriguez commended Fursa for the initiative.He spoke about the importance of youth to be engaged in the Global Goals. We need to let youth know that the Global Goals are not just for the government or the UN, they are for everybody and that the Global Goals will not be reached in 2030 without very active participation of young people, he said.Fursa founder Ruge Mutahaba said the partnership with the UN would see youth in Dodoma, Kigoma and Dar es Salaam trained on the global goals and on ways to add value in their products. For the past three years we have been going all over the country supporting youth and startups with greater capacity building at the individual level, to access knowledge of raw materials, markets, brand management and financial management, he said.
