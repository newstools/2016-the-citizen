According to Destiny Magazine the star always wanted to have a baby in her late 20s: People who know me, know that I always wanted to have my kid in my late 20s and that was from a health perspective, because you are generally physically more capable of carrying a baby in your 20s of course you can carry a child in your 30s. It s so funny how everything has turned out, she said. Her baby shower went down this past weekend and it seemed like a joyous occasion. It was great timing too since the baby was so close to arriving. Congratulations to her and husband, Zakes Bantwini! Brought to you by Bona Magzine
