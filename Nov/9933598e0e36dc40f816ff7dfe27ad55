David Miller struck the second highest score in domestic T20 Challenge history but it was still not enough as the Knights were beaten by the Titans with one ball to spare in their latest clash at Willowmoore Park in Benoni on Friday. The Proteas star smashed a career-best unbeaten 120 (61 balls, 8 fours, 9 sixes), the second ton of his career, as the visitors amassed 185/6 after winning the toss and batting. But in an epic chase, Heinrich Klaasen hit 52 (30 balls, 6 fours, 2 sixes) to give the hosts a solid enough foundation, which was built on nicely by Farhaan Behardien (30 off 18 balls, 4 fours). The Knights kept chipping away at the wickets, though, and after removing the key ones of top-scorer Klaasen, Qaasim Adams (6) and Albie Morkel (13) within the space of four mid-innings overs, the defending champions looked done for. They were then pegged back by more tight bowling as they reached the final three overs on 148/5, still needing 38 off 16 balls. But David Wiese blasted Dillon du Preez for 22 in the 18th over to turn the tide, although he did fall for 34 (15 balls, 1 four, 4 sixes) on the last ball of the penultimate over when just six was required for victory. The set Behardien followed next ball to leave Shaun von Berg and Malusi Siboto to get the winning runs, with the pair struggling to get Shadley van Schalkwyk off the square. It came down to two runs from the final ball, and when the bowler delivered a waste-high no ball, the batsmen were able to scramble a quick single and snatch a memorable win, a third in as many games for the top-of-the-table Titans.
