Soshanguve residents gathered on Mabopane highway on Thursday to pray for a decrease in the number of accidents on the road, reports the Pretoria Moot Rekord. Soshanguve resident John Molepo said residents, taxi associations and churches convened at Transfer BP garage at 4.30pm and proceeded to Mabopane Highway for the prayer session. Residents laid wreaths and lit candles as they remembered the lives that had been lost in road accidents. As we approach the festive season we all hope to spend it with our loved ones, but the reality is while some will be celebrating others will be burying their loved ones due to road accidents, said Molepo. Molepo said according to statistics from Tshwane metro police department (TMPD) there had been 219 accidents on Mabopane highway since January. Mabopane Highway connects most of the people of the north township to the Tshwane CBD. Molepo said the awareness campaigns about safety should be done regularly and traffic officers should be highly visible.
