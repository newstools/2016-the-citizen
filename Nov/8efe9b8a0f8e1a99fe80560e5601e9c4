One person died and at least 23 were injured when a bus and a minibus taxi collided on the N8 near Thaba Nchu in the Free State on Saturday. ER24 paramedics and other services attended to the incident and found that a bus and taxi had collided, ER24 spokeswoman Chitra Bodasing-Harduth said. Fire and rescue was on scene as well to extricate some people who were trapped in the taxi. Sadly there was nothing that could be done for one patient who was found laying on the road. The person was declared dead. One person who was in a critical condition was airlifted to hospital. All the other patients, who sustained injuries ranging from minor to serious, were treated and transported to various local hospitals by ambulance. The cause of the accident was unknown. It was believed that other patients were transported to hospital privately as well, Bodasing-Harduth said.
