The Engen Volkswagen Cup finale at Zwartkops Raceway on Saturday produced a showstopping result when Signature Motorsport became the first team in the 20-year history of the championship to claim first, second and third place in the series. Christopher Shorter (33 Payen / Turn 1) is the 2016 Engen Volkswagen Cup champion with his teammates Bradley Liebenberg (12 Ferodo) and Keagan Masters (18 Champion) taking second and third place. The trio claimed not only the Junior title in this series but also the overall championship honours. The margin of victory in the championship was just a single point between Shorter and Liebenberg. Masters was also recognised for his achievements on the track, being awarded Rookie of the Year for his performance. The Masters champion for 2016 is Shaun La R serv e (M3 Alpine Motors / Compendium Insurance), with Juan Gerber (M8 Glasfit / Ctrack) taking second place and Trevor Bland (M2 Universal Health Care/Phoenix) third for the season. The battle for this championship was no less intense and La R serv e s margin of victory was just two points despite scoring the most race victories of any driver this season while Gerber had only four points on Bland. Kuda Vazhure (19 Volkswagen Motorsport) was recognised by the vote from his peers in Engen Volkswagen Cup, as the Most Improved Driver this season. In true style, the final race weekend provided a mix of drama that saw some tense moments on track and saw the early retirement of Masters champion La R serv e from race two, while overall champion Liebenberg ended up right at the back of the field, having to fight to score any points in the race.
