There is something unseemly about our Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula lashing out at Olympic silver medallist Sunette Viljoen on social media. It is evident the star athlete is clearly in conflict with both the department of sport and Sascoc, the body controlling Olympic sport in this country, and has been a major thorn in the side of both for some time. At issue is the funding Viljoen who won silver in Rio, has two World Championship bronze medals and is the reigning African champion believes she is entitled to through Sascoc s Opex programme and incentives provided by the department of sport. This sticking point is something the athlete has complained vocally about in the past. Clearly, it would have been better to have settled the matter in an adult fashion behind closed doors. But what seems to be inertia on the part of Sascoc and the department to open their coffers and fulfil promised payment led Viljoen to post a WhatsApp conversation between herself and Mbalula, not perhaps the most diplomatic of reactions. But the minister claiming in a number of tweets that he had been harassed and abused by Viljoen and that she was causing anarchy is surely not worthy of the office he holds.
