As the Cape summer season gets under way many trainers are starting to bring their horses back from long rests over the winter months. Unfortunately that does not make life easy for punters who could find things difficult for them in Race 8 at Kenilworth today, a MR 101 Handicap over 1800m on the Winter Course. As a result it could be safer to go with horses who have proven fitness and those include Milton, Prince Of Wales, Icy Trail, Waiting For Rain and especially, Ultimate Dollar. The best of these could be Ultimate Dollar who will be having his third run after a rest. His only run during the KwaZulu-Natal winter season was in The Sledgehammer (Listed) at Scottsville in April where he ran second last. That was his first run since last year s Summer Cup but whatever was troubling him seems to have reoccurred. Justin Snaith s charge was then off the track until the Matchem Stakes over 1400m at Durbanville in October. He ran poorly over a distance far short of his best but then came out to run in a MR 96 Handicap over this course and distance in which he led from the start but was caught close home and finished a 1.35-length third behind Icy Trail. The horse separating the pair was another Snaith runner, Prince Of Wales. Courtesy of claiming apprentice Craig Bantam Ultimate Dollar is now 4kg better off with both of them. He is a lot fitter and should be able to turn the tables. Milton has been ultra-consistent and in his two races over the course and distance has finished second. He is also a strong front runner who goes well for MJ Byleveld and should contest the finish.
