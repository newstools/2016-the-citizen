In an interview with DJ Sbu on his breakfast show, rapper Cassper Nyovest opened up about his music and the women in his life: his ex-girlfriend Boitumelo Thulo, his mother and crush Minenhle Dlamini. In his music, he has rapped about dating Boity, and even though he never gave her a baby as he said he would, he still thinks she is the best. He has also rapped about marrying Minnie, which is proving to be difficult, as she has a man. Cassper blames Minnie&#8217;s new man for standing in his way of finally dating the girl of his dreams. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s this dude, and I don&#8217;t even know him. I think he&#8217;s a good guy, and I think that&#8217;s maybe what she needs in her life. I think that they have a good relationship going on. But you know, every good things comes to an end, baby.&#8221; Also read: Minnie, NaakMusiq spark dating rumours Cassper&#8217;s crush on Minnie is so serious he discusses it with his mother, who seems to be smitten with her too. &#8220;We we just talking about the woman I want to marry.
