The Sean Tarry-trained Rikitikitana looked a bit of an unlucky loser in his latest start and it will be some just reward for his connections if he won Race 5, a MR 86 Handicap over 1600m on the Greyville Polytrack on Friday. Rikitikitana ran on strongly that day and finished third and just a head behind the winner Open Heir. The 1800m of that race does stretch the stamina of the Toreador gelding and he seems his very best over the slightly shorter distance. Three runners who deserve respect are Last Tiger, Thirtytwo Squadron and Golden Fort. This card is a difficult one but we could at least get off to a good start as Cabinda is the likely winner of Race 1, a Maiden Plate over 1000m. This Michael Roberts-trained three-year-old gelding has been a runner-up in his last three starts. Roberts has decided to drop down in distance to 1000m and put blinkers aboard Cabinda and that could do the trick. Another Delpech-ridden runner on the card, On That Note could be worth looking at as a possible banker in Race 4, a Maiden Plate over 1600m. This Tiger Ridge filly has improved with the step up in distance and this course and distance should suit the Dean Kannemeyer-trained filly. Kilmokea is sure to prove a threat as his last two runs were very good.
