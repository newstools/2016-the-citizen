The implementation of the proposed R3,500 minimum wage will increase labour costs, trade union Solidarity said on Tuesday. The implementation of the proposed minimum wage will increase labour costs as a whole, and as a consequence, businesses will employ fewer people in future, said Dr Eugene Brink, senior researcher at the Solidarity Research Institute (SRI). In the end, the unemployed who can t find jobs, as well as quite a number of working people who would eventually lose their jobs, would pay for it.

There comes a time where labour would simply not be affordable anymore and it would be cheaper to invest in machines. Pick n Pay is already experimenting with cashier-less tills. Those who stand to benefit from the minimum wage are the very ones whose jobs could be the first to be replaced by technology. He said the minimum wage was yet another form of increasing economic interventionism that would further cripple the formal private sector and would deny people the right to make voluntary choices when it comes to remuneration, employment and appointments. Smaller businesses will be especially hit hard, as well as those workers who simply want to get a foot in the door somewhere in the labour market and who are prepared to work for less than the minimum wage. At the same time, it would simply aggravate bureaucratic red tape in the labour market. &#8211; African News Agency
