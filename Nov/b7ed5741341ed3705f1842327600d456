EFF leader Julius Malema granted an interview to SABC&#8217;s show Question Time on Tuesday afternoon, despite his misgivings about appearing on the &#8220;propaganda machine&#8221; of the SABC. He started off by telling his interviewer, Mpho Tsedu, that the SABC was no different than the Gupta family&#8217;s news channel ANN7, as it had been &#8220;captured&#8221; by the Guptas, so being there was &#8220;a waste of time&#8221;. However, he said the public broadcaster was still worth fighting for. He appeared to approve of the commission in parliament investigating the running of the SABC. He charged that the SABC&#8217;s propaganda was in favour of a &#8220;faction&#8221; of the ANC led by President Jacob Zuma, not even the whole ANC. He joked that there was only one person left on the SABC board. &#8220;How can you call one person a board? It&#8217;s a joke.&#8221; Moving on to his controversial recent comments about land in white hands being transferred to black ownership, he said that he could not say what would happen in future, but he was still in favour of a peaceful solution to the &#8220;problem&#8221;. He was asked if white people &#8220;were safe&#8221;. &#8220;I&#8217;m not a prophet; I can only speak for now. A peaceful transfer of land is possible now.&#8221; He repeated his assertion that &#8220;no one (whites) will be driven into the sea&#8221;. &#8220;Let there be a peaceful transfer of land to the people. &#8220;White people are more than safe under Julius Malema, under the EFF. I don&#8217;t want to see a single drop of blood.&#8221; It would be a different matter when it came to racists, however. He said that in his view the reason why there were &#8220;few white people in Nigeria&#8221; was because &#8220;Nigerians don&#8217;t tolerate nonsense&#8221; and he was &#8220;like Nigerians&#8221; towards racists. Malema dismissed the incitement charges brought against him by the state, saying that it wasn&#8217;t a criminal matter, but politically motivated. &#8220;I&#8217;m reiterating what Mandela said [the call to occupy vacant land according to the Freedom Charter]. The decision to criminalise me was taken at Luthuli House with [National Director of Public Prosecutions Shaun] Abrahams.&#8221; He was referring to a very controversial meeting last month when Abrahams briefed Zuma at the ANC headquarters, allegedly against legal protocol. He said the decision to charge him for things he had said in 2014 was taken there and it was merely &#8220;an attempt to intimidate me&#8221; and a &#8220;response to Thuli Madonsela&#8217;s [state capture] report&#8221; because they knew the EFF had given Madonsela a lot of information.

He alleged that Zuma&#8217;s son Duduzane, a Gupta business associate, had asked him to meet them in 2011, but he told them to write to the secretary-general of the league, giving their reasons why he should meet them. Malema said the Guptas then &#8220;disappeared&#8221;. He claimed that he had already warned against handing the ANC to the Gupta family in 2011. &#8220;This is not what we fought for in Polokwane [in 2007]. I said these things next to Zuma, not [only after I was expelled from the ANC].&#8221; He repeated the allegation that Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula, then Malema&#8217;s friend. had been called by the Guptas to be informed that he would be appointed as minister, before it was officially announced. &#8220;They told him he would move from police to sports. I don&#8217;t go around spreading lies. Once I say something you must know, this is a killer point, I&#8217;ve got them.&#8221; Malema charged that if the ANC had &#8220;listened to me in 2011 and not responded to criticism by expelling me, then we [the EFF] wouldn&#8217;t be here today [in this situation]&#8221;. &#8220;Black people are suppressed. Wherever I witness the exploitation of black people I speak out. I do not go to resturants because I cannot tolerate the way blacks are treated in those places. &#8220;Even here at the SABC building there are no white cleaners, no white security guards, no white tea lady.&#8221; Julius Malema: The future looks bright in the EFF, if you can&#39;t see get classes #QuestionTimeInterview #QuestionTime pic.twitter.com/PIijxYkzBX &mdash; Azania Afrika (@SAYoungLion) November 15, 2016
