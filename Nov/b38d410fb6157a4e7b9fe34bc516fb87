A man did an experiment to see how honest well-off people were compared to the homeless. He walked around, pretending to be blind and holding a fake winning Lotto ticket, and asked random people on the streets if he had won. The first well-off man he approached told him it was not the winning ticket, looked around to see if anyone was watching him and just took off with the ticket. The second one just flatly denied the &#8216;blind&#8217; man was holding a winning ticket but offered to &#8220;get rid of it&#8221; for it, while putting the ticket in his pocket. When he was told the man he had tried to rob of a winning was not blind, he got furious.
