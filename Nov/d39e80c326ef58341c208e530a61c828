Facebook-owned Instagram hiked the pressure on Snapchat on Monday, adding ephemeral live video broadcasts and vanishing direct messages. Send anything you want, from inside jokes to your worst selfies, Instagram said. Unlike other messages in Direct, these photos and videos disappear from your friends inboxes after they ve seen them. The updates appeared aimed at getting people to use Instagram more for casual, quirky moments instead of seeing it as a platform for sharing life highlights or polished posts meant to linger. Since trying unsuccessfully to buy Snapchat several years ago, Facebook has turned to cloning popular features.
