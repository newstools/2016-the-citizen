National Treasury on Friday warned of the dire implications if the Division of Revenue Amendment (DORA) Bill is not passed before year end. While expressing confidence that the bill will be passed before the end of 2016 after it was stalled for two days in a row when the National Assembly could not achieve a quorum, Treasury said in a statement the failure to pass this bill and the Adjustments Appropriation Bill could affect the provision of services to several government institutions. The DORA bill proposes revisions to the national government equitable share and to conditional grants to provinces and municipalities. Delayed departmental spending of increased allocations may hamper service delivery, and may even mean that departments are unable to spend funds effectively before the end of the 2016/17 financial year. This may result in under-spending, the statement said.

If so spent, institutions will be unable to return the required funds to the fiscus after the bills have become law. Ultimately institutions would then be deemed to have overspent their budget allocations at financial year end. The DORA Bill has been rescheduled and will be put on the agenda for Tuesday s National Assembly sitting. While some of the biggest opposition parties deliberately left the House on Tuesday and Wednesday, it emerged that many African National Congress (ANC) MPs were not in the house to use their majority to reach the quorum of 201 votes. ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu said the ruling party took full responsibility for the bill not being passed, adding that disciplinary action would be taken against ANC MPs, who he described as ill-disciplined, who were not in the House on Tuesday and Wednesday without leave. -African News Agency
