In an economy turned sway-back by political ineptitude, growing investment apathy, drought-fuelled food inflation and the staggering burden of unemployment, determining a minimum wage is a greased tightrope. Set the figure too low and the working poor those lucky enough to hold a job will be as hard-pressed as their unemployed fellow citizens to stave off starvation. Set the mean too high and the employers will react adversely and future employment opportunities will dry up as surely as the El Nino phenomenon swept across the country, turning streams into unwilling trickles and dams into despondent puddles.

Predictably, this has found little favour with the unions, with Irvin Jim of the powerful Numsa bloc rejecting the figure with the contempt it deservers , saying it was aimed at keeping black workers at the bottom of the employment chain. Notionally, this has some merit. In a society as complex as ours, it could be seen as overly simplistic. Both government and the employers must rethink the matrix and find a real solution.
