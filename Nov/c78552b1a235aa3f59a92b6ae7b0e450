Twenty three people were injured when the bakkie they were travelling in overturned in Snathing in Edendale, Pietermaritzburg, on Sunday afternoon, KwaZulu-Natal paramedics said. Paramedics from ER24, Emergency Medical Rescue Services (EMRS) and other services arrived in the district road shortly after 2pm, where they found the bakkie lying upside down against a guardrail. All of the occupants were found near the bakkie, ER24 spokesperson Werner Vermaak said. Twenty people were found with minor injuries while three others were found with moderate injuries. They were all treated on the scene and later transported to Greys, Northdale, and Pietermaritzburg Provincial hospitals. It is understood that the driver of the bakkie lost control of the vehicle shortly before it overturned. The cause was still unknown, Vermaak said. African News Agency (ANA)
