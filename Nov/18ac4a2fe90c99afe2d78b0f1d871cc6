Labour has welcomed new amendments to the Extension of Security of Tenure Amendment (Esta) Bill, currently before parliament, which will give farm workers and their relatives more rights. The legislation protects farm workers from evictions and allows them legal representation in such cases, protecting their human rights and those of their dependants and relatives. The bill also obliges farm owners to give farm dwellers access to grave sites and maintain farm workers homes. Trade union federation Cosatu, which made its submission on the legislation to the rural development and land reform portfolio committee public hearings on Tuesday, described the Esta Bill as a step forward. This is a long overdue and badly needed intervention to help South Africa s highly exploited and vulnerable farm workers, Cosatu said.

Government and parliament need to act with urgency to advance and protect the needs of workers, Parks said. Cosatu asked parliament to include in the legislation progressive clauses against farm worker evictions, agreed to at the National Economic Development and Labour Council. This omission by government is worrying and must be corrected, Parks said. Cosatu welcomed the amendments, but the solution to protecting farm workers was for government and the private sector to provide them with decent arable land, equity and basic services.
