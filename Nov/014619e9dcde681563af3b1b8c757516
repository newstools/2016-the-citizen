The death of Cuba&#8217;s Fidel Castro prompted reaction across the spectrum Saturday with some world leaders describing him as a friend and ally, while rights groups recalled his repression of basic freedoms. Here are some early responses to the death of the 90-year-old Cold War icon, whose life was defined by his resistance to the capitalist United States. Barack Obama &#8220;History will record and judge the enormous impact of this singular figure on the people and world around him,&#8221; the US president said after the death of Cuba&#8217;s revolutionary leader. &#8220;During my presidency, we have worked hard to put the past behind us, pursuing a future in which the relationship between our two countries is defined not by our differences but by the many things that we share as neighbours and friends,&#8221; added Obama, who made a landmark visit to Cuba in March after diplomatic ties between the two nations were restored. Donald Trump The US president-elect simply tweeted &#8220;Fidel Castro is dead!&#8221; Back in September he commented on the historic rapprochement between the United States and Cuba threatening to reverse the executive orders &#8220;unless the Castro regime meets our demands&#8221;, which include &#8220;religious and political freedom for the Cuban people and the freeing of political prisoners&#8221;. Vladimir Putin &#8220;The name of this distinguished statesman is rightly considered the symbol of an era in modern world history,&#8221; the Russian president said in a message to Cuban President Raul Castro, Fidel&#8217;s brother, cited by the Kremlin. &#8220;Fidel Castro was a sincere and reliable friend of Russia.&#8221; Mikhail Gorbachev &#8220;Fidel stood up and strengthened his country during the harshest American blockade, when there was colossal pressure on him and he still took his country out of this blockade to a path of independent development,&#8221; Interfax news agency quoted the former Soviet leader as saying. &#8220;In the past years, even when Fidel Castro was not formally in power, his role in strengthening the country was huge.&#8221; Pope Francis The leader of the world&#8217;s Roman Catholics sent a telegramme saying he was &#8220;praying to the Lord that he (Castro) may rest in peace&#8221;. Ban Ki-moon &#8220;Under former president (Fidel) Castro, Cuba made progress in the areas of education, literacy and health,&#8221; the UN secretary-general told journalists. Xi Jinping China&#8217;s president hailed Castro in a message read out on state television. &#8220;The Chinese people have lost a good and true comrade,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Comrade Castro will live forever. &#8221; Diego Maradona The Argentine football legend lamented Castro&#8217;s death saying &#8220;I&#8217;m terribly sad as he was like a second father&#8221;. Jacob Zuma The South African president gave one of the warmest tributes to the late Cuban leader. &#8220;President Castro identified with our struggle against apartheid. He inspired the Cuban people to join us in our own struggle. As a way of paying homage to the memory of President Castro, the strong bonds of solidarity, cooperation and friendship that exist between South Africa and Cuba must be maintained and nurtured,&#8221; Zuma said. Francois Hollande Castro embodied Cuba&#8217;s revolution in both its &#8220;hopes&#8221; and its later &#8220;disappointments&#8221;, the French President said in a statement. &#8220;An actor of the Cold War&#8230; he represented, for Cubans, pride in rejecting external domination,&#8221; Hollande added, alluding to Castro&#8217;s opposition to the United States. Nicolas Maduro The Venezuelan president, Cuba&#8217;s main ally in the region, said of Castro on Twitter: &#8220;It is up to us to continue his legacy and carry his flag of independence.&#8221; Felipe VI &#8220;Fidel Castro is a figure of indisputable historical importance,&#8221; the Spanish king said in a telegramme to his brother and current Cuban President Raul Castro. Narendra Modi India&#8217;s prime minister sent his &#8220;deepest condolences&#8221; to Cuba. &#8220;May his soul rest in peace,&#8221; he tweeted. &#8220;Fidel Castro was one of the most iconic personalities of the 20th century. India mourns the loss of a great friend.&#8221; Mohammad Javad Zarif Castro was &#8220;a unique figure who fought against colonialism and exploitation&#8221; and was &#8220;a model of the fight for independence by oppressed nations&#8221;, said Iran&#8217;s foreign minister, the Fars news agency reported. Rodrigo Duterte For the Philippines&#8217; president, Castro distinguished himself by &#8220;standing up against the West and imperialism&#8221;. Communist Vietnam Vietnam&#8217;s official Communist news agency hailed Castro as &#8220;a great leader&#8221; who was &#8220;the shining reflection of the independence and revolutionary movements of countries in Latin America and around the world&#8221;. Amnesty International The London-based human rights organisation said the state of free expression in Cuba was Castro&#8217;s &#8220;darkest legacy&#8221;. &#8220;Castro&#8217;s achievements in improving access to public services for millions of Cubans were tempered by a systemic repression of basic freedoms,&#8221; Amnesty said
