Police were yesterday still searching for the body of Madelien Murray, 40, who went missing after her car was pulled under a low-water bridge into the Apies River in Pretoria. Her son Hanko Murray, 21, who was with her in the car, tried to grab hold of his mother as the water washed them downstream. He managed to save himself and ran for help. Hanko was driving at the time of the freak incident. He is now being treated in the hospital. His uncle, Francois Roux, said he was praying that his sister could still be found.
