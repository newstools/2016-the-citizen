If there were ever any lingering doubts about the anarchy vested in the hijacking of the #FeesMustFall campaign, they must have been rapidly dispelled by the chaos that descended on the Soshanguve campus of the Tshwane University of Technology this week. Heavily armed private security, searches of students wanting to write their papers, and buses lined up to transport those merely wishing to do so to the Tshwane Events Centre played counterpoint to the stone-throwing and bus burning havoc caused by those opposed to the completion of exams. None of this can have been conducive to the kind of collected concentration needed by those who had struggled to study through the turmoil roiling around them and decided to write what could possibly be the most crucial examinations of their lives. A well intentioned upsurge of feelings which blurred the lines of race, gender and party affiliations, against the high costs of tertiary education and the apparent failure by government to address these serious concerns is a sad point to ponder in anything near cohesive, concrete terms. This apparent apathy by the government led to a rapid escalation of emotions and things turned nasty. Police, ill equipped to deal with the disgruntled students, reacted in predictable fashion to the vituperation, rocks and even Molotov cocktails which rained down on them. The tear gas came out. The rubber bullets were loaded and the triggers cocked. The students reacted. Recrimination followed recrimination. The violence on and off campus escalated, leaving few winners in a confrontation that, if dialogue and forward thinking had prevailed over the thuggish seizure of the movement, should never have happened. The events in Tshwane beg the worrying question: how could we as a country, have let it go this far? And, as a rider, which institution is to be targeted next?
