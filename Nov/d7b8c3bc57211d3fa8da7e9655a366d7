17 cable thieves were arrested at a scrapyard while trying to sell stripped copper cables in Waltloo, Pretoria, on Thursday evening. The men were found after Tshwane metro police (TMPD) received a tip off of cables being ripped off at a substation, spokesperson Senior Superintendent Isaac Mahamba said. &#8220;The officers responded immediately but did not find them at the scene. The suspects were spotted by members of the public at a scrapyard around the area trying to sell the cables,&#8221; he said. All 17 men, aged between 30 and 45, were arrested. They are expected to appear in court soon, Mahamba said. &#8220;The Tshwane Metro Police Department would like to applaud members of the public for assisting the TMPD officers in arresting these suspects. The department will continue to fight cable theft in the city and to protect citizens.&#8221;
