With the Telkom 947 Cycle Challenge this weekend, the organising committee is urging all road users to familiarise themselves with closures on Sunday. The Telkom 947 Cycle Challenge is in its 20th year and is expected to attract more than 30 000 cyclists. The race starts and ends at Century Property s Riversands Commercial Park, which is just off the R511 in Fourways. As a necessary precaution to keep all the cyclists safe, some roads will be closed on the day by the Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department, Johannesburg Roads Agency and the City of Joburg. These will be closed for as short a time as possible to ensure the safety of the cyclists. Motorists are urged to use alternate routes during affected times. The route meanders through the streets of Johannesburg from Summit Road, around the city on the M1, Jan Smuts and Witkoppen, bringing cyclists home via Cedar Road, through Steyn City Boulevard and back up to the finish, along Riversands Boulevard. Residents affected by the road closures are urged to familiarise themselves and take note of the times. Visit www.cyclechallenge. co.za for all road closures, a route map and an interactive map. On the website, click on the Route tab and a block will appear; insert your departure point and then your destination point before pressing enter. There will be a number of dedicated supporter zones this year, including Telkom spectator zones along Jan Smuts, Witkoppen and a 947 and Telkom powerzone at Dunkeld. For those who would like to come to the start and finish, free parking will be made available on site at Riversands Commercial Park. The Cycle Challenge encourages cyclists to Ride for a Purpose , which gives everyone the opportunity to support a cause.
