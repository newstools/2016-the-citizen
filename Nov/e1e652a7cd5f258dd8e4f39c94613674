As negative criticism from Twitter users at Metro FM&#8217;s Whose Show Is It hosts Khanyi Mbau and Somizi Mhlongo continues, some have taken it as far as asking when she will be leaving the show. &#8220;@somizi @MbauReloaded @METROFMSA guys please resign this show is boring yall sound confused yall should do the 00:00 till 05:00 show #wsiia,&#8221; tweeted user @Lebo_Pirates. Mbau may have ignored many negative tweeps, but she could not let this one slide. &#8220;We will resign when Twitter closes.. Deal?&#8221; she told the user. Being one of the biggest social media networks, we doubt Twitter will be closing anytime soon. One user tweeted that knowing that the radio industry had people like Somizi and Mbau made them sad. Another took it a step further and questioned Mbau&#8217;s intelligence. &#8220;@MbauReloaded is this true?? rumour has it u couldn&#8217;t do simple maths multiply by Zero,&#8221; they said. Mbau sarcastically told the follower the rumour was true. We will resign when Twitter closes.. Deal? https://t.co/x4pAqDGyTS &mdash; MBAU (@MbauReloaded) November 14, 2016 The two hosts have been receiving negative criticism from the day they were announced as the hosts of the new show, with most calling for &#8220;better&#8221; hosts. But there have been listeners who seem to love the show, always telling the hosts they enjoy it and sharing the jokes Somizi makes on air. Mbau, who says negative criticism will not stop her, has been criticised for everything she has done, including the music career she resurrected after signing with Mabala Noise this year. Not long before she was signed, the singer released a single, Shake. Though she received positive comments on Twitter after only releasing a 14-second long clip of the single, which features the lyrics: You wanna take me to London; all you want is the bum-bum&#8221;, some thought the lyrics were &#8220;horrible&#8221;. &nbsp; Read more: Khanyi Mbau hits back at criticism of &#8216;horrible&#8217; lyrics
