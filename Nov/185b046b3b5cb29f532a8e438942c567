Raven Klaasen got off to a superb start with American partner Rajeev Ram on Monday, as they racked up a straight sets victory over the top seeded pairing in their opening doubles match at the ATP World Tour Finals in London. Klaasen, the only SA player in action at the lucrative year-end tournament, joined Ram in a convincing display against the French duo of Nicolas Mahut and Pierre-Hugues Herbert. Earning a 7-5 6-4 victory, the No 7 seeds took the early advantage in their group, with two round robin matches remaining ahead of this weekend&#8217;s playoffs. Should Klaasen win the title with Ram, he would become the first South African to lift the World Tour Finals crown in more than 14 years.
