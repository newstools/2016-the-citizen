Choreographer and Idols SA judge Somizi Mhlongo has an idea for how Kiernan &#8216;AKA&#8217; Forbes and Nkosinathi &#8216;Black Coffee&#8217; Maphumulo&#8217;s beef can be solved. Taking to Instagram, Somizi shared a video of himself just after landing in Durban, commenting on the posters of the celebrities at the airport. The first was of him and model/TV presenter Minenhle Dlamini. His camera then moved on to Black Coffee, Refiloe &#8216;Cassper Nyovest&#8217; Phoolo and AKA. However, his camera quickly moved from AKA&#8217;s poster, saying he should run away from the One Time hit maker. Though he showed us that he was still not a fan of AKA, he thinks the three should form a group and call it Destiny&#8217;s Child, and Cassper should be the Beyonce of the group. Not such a bad idea since the Mama I Made It hit maker has previously said he wanted South Africans to treat him like Beyonce. But then, since AKA and Black Coffee are not the best of friends, Somizi thinks Cassper should always be in the middle when the three perform to avoid another slapping incident. Though AKA has slapped Cassper before, it might not happen again since the two have made peace, judging by the pictures that circulated on social media showing them hugging it out after Cassper&#8217;s performance at Orlando Stadium. The Black Coffee-AKA situation might take some time before they hug it out, though. But thankfully, Cassper will be there in case Mzansi gets its own Destiny&#8217;s Child.
