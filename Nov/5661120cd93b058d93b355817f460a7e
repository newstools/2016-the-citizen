The world, still reeling from Donald Trump s success in the US presidential elections, is holding its collective breath on just who the property tycoon turned populist politician appoints to join his first panel of primary advisers. There has been much speculation that Trump will opt for retired US Marine general James Mattis as his secretary for defence, a selection tailor made to distance the White House even further from Trump s vocal liberal critics. Mattis is a 66-year-old career military man who s nickname, Mad Dog Mattis , should alone be reason enough to understand his straightforward approach to any matters arising. It is also difficult to pigeonhole the highly decorated Mattis, whose military callsign was Chaos , as a bleeding heart. Even his public outpourings often have a distinctly warlike message. There are some assholes in the world that just need to be shot. There are hunters and there are victims. By your discipline, you will decide if you are a hunter or a victim ; and Be polite, be professional, but have a plan to kill everybody you meet. Not, we would suggest, the ideal platform to promote tranquillity in a climate of conflict with the world literally reeling under pointless wars across the globe.
