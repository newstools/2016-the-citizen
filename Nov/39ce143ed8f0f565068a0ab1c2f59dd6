A 67-year-old Limpopo man will be in his 90s when he is due to get out of jail after a North Gauteng High Court judge yesterday sentenced him to two life terms for burning a woman and her daughter to death. Judge Eben Jordaan sentenced Elias Alpheus Matlowa to life imprisonment for the August 2012 murders of Lindiwe Masilela and her 12-year-old daughter Sabelo Masombuka. The mother and child died a gruesome death after Matlowa set their room alight in a fit of anger because Masilela had borrowed his cellphone while they were drinking at a tavern, but failed to return it. Both were burnt beyond recognition. Matlowa was overheard asking for matches and threatening to burn Masilela s shack before the incident. Matlowa has 24 previous convictions, including eight for assault and two for culpable homicide. Judge Jordaan said Matlowa had thus already killed four people in his lifetime. The incident severely traumatised Masilela s 17-year-old son, who was living with his grandmother at the time but was very close to his mother and sister. According to a victim impact report, the young man battled to sleep because of nightmares. Judge Jordaan said Matlowa clearly had no remorse whatsoever and his sentence must be a deterrent to others planning the same thing.
