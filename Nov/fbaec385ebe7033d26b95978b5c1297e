Sars was quick to add that it processed 99.9% of returns electronically, assessing 92.4% of them within three seconds.

A total of R15.5 billion in tax refunds had been paid to 1.98 million taxpayers by Friday s deadline, Sars said. The total number of returns received included 4.16 million individual submissions and 47 000 submissions by trusts for the 2015-2016 tax year, and 1.52 million returns for previous tax years from individuals and trusts. Sars said its contact centre had handled more than 3.6 million calls and branch offices had assisted in excess of 5.1 million taxpayers during the return season. It added that 173 000 taxpayers made use of the Help You e-File channel and 44 373 had used Sars mobile application. Penalties totalling R1.64 billion had been imposed on defaulting taxpayers. Sars commissioner Tom Moyane said: Sars wishes to express its appreciation to all those taxpayers that submitted their tax returns before the deadline. Paying tax is the highest form of patriotism. He added that Sars wanted to thank all its employees for making tax season successful. The focus, discipline and selfless service of the men and women of Sars are what makes Sars one of the best revenue services in the world, Moyane said.
