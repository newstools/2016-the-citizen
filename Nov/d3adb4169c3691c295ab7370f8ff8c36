Brazil international Coutinho had a scan on his right ankle on Monday after being carried off on a stretcher in Saturday&#8217;s win over Sunderland. Reds boss Jurgen Klopp confirmed on Tuesday that the 24-year-old will probably be out until the new year. &#8220;Phil needs between five and a few weeks until we have him back,&#8221; Klopp said ahead of their League Cup quarter-final against Leeds. &#8220;We will see. He is not in (to face Leeds) and for the next few games.&#8221; Coutinho has been Liverpool&#8217;s most influential player this season, scoring six times in 13 appearances in all competitions, but Klopp insisted they would cope without him. &#8220;It is no excuse for anything. As good as he is he does not decide games by himself, although it sometimes looks like this,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is a team performance we create and he is a very important part of this team, absolutely. &#8220;Of course we can handle it. If he is not in you have to show &#8211; and we will show.&#8221;
