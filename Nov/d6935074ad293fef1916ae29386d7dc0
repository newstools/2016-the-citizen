What Julius Malema, the self-styled commander-in-chief of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), singularly fails to do in quoting the Freedom Charter in his often inflammatory observations to justify land occupation is to contextualise his source. The charter, signed at the Congress of the People in Kliptown on June 26, 1955, as the savage stranglehold of apartheid tightened inexorably on human rights and dignity, was a truly remarkable document for its time. But Malema and all who subscribe to his populist grandiloquence are using the 10-point charter selectively. The preamble is more specific, stating: We, the People of South Africa, declare for all our country and the world to know: that South Africa belongs to all who live in it, black and white, and that no government can justly claim authority unless it is based on the will of all the people &#8230; In short, the charter is in essence inclusive and neither racially loaded or exclusive of any group. It is to this important aspect that the charter owes its majesty. And it is from this seed that our much-lauded constitution took root and grew. It would also be germane to remember that it is this very constitution, rather than any other rhetoric, that governs our democracy.
