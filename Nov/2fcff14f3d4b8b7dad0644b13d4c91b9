Moving on from what couldn&#8217;t have been an easy situation has led Zinhle to share her story with women going through similar heartbreak. She started her own blog and began sharing motivational quotes, books she was reading and more. Speaking to True Love, the businesswoman said: &#8220;I can&#8217;t not want to help other women with my story because of what happened. What occurred back then happened for a reason. The main focus is to go on and move forward.&#8221; She learned self-love. During her time after the breakup, Zinhle allowed her self to wallow in self-pity but promptly set out to get her life back on track. She invested in herself by travelling, refining her business plans and spending time with positive people who uplifted her. She realised her self-worth. &#8220;I also have reminders on my phone that pop up at 1pm everyday, which say &#8216;Zinhle you are beautiful&#8217;, &#8216;you should be proud of yourself&#8217;, &#8216;look how far you have come&#8217; or &#8216;you have a beautiful smile&#8217;.&#8221; While the process to healing has been a lengthy one, Zinhle says she has also become more selfish by putting herself first and spoiling herself. &#8220;It&#8217;s time we set aside some &#8216;me-time&#8217; and just do the things we love and make us happy for a change.&#8221; Though she was 100% happy with AKA, Zinhle says she is in an even better space now. Her business is doing well, she and AKA are coparenting well, and she has found her own man, Brendon Naidoo.
