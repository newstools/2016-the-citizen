Tracey Hartley of Feral Cat Rescue Trust in Durban has warned cat owners to make sure their pets are vaccinated against feline panleukopenia. This warning comes after an outbreak at a feral cat colony on North Coast Road, Northglen News reported. According to Hartley, three cats have already died and two more are in a serious condition. This virus, also referred to as feline distemper affects the rapidly dividing blood cells in the body. Because the blood cells are under attack, this virus can lead to an anaemic condition. It is a highly contagious, often fatal, viral disease of cats. &#8220;The virus is very resistant and can survive for a year outside the cat s body. I urge pet owners to make sure their cat s vaccinations are up to date. So far we ve only identified this colony as being affected, she said. Hartley added the virus was preventable. &#8211; Caxton News Service
