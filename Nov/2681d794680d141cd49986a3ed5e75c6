The Democratic Alliance has accused Hlaudi Motsoeneng of failing to pay local musicians over R25 million in royalty payments, despite his constant claims of support for local content. According to Timeslive, this was revealed in a reply to a DA parliamentary question which indicated that two organisations, the South African Music Performance Rights Association (SAMPRA) and the Independent Music Performance Rights Association (IMPRA), were owed R25.7 million by the SABC&#8217;s radio division since 2014.

The SABC announced the introduction of a 90% local content quota for its radio stations and two TV channels earlier this year. Most artists welcomed the move, thanking the broadcaster for finally acknowledging local talent while there was mixed reaction from the public. Van Damme added that the party firmly supported local talent and vowed to follow up on the matter and ensure the entity paid the musicians money owed. &nbsp;
