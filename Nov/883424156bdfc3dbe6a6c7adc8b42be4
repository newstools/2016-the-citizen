President-elect Donald Trump meets Saturday with Mitt Romney, one of his most vocal Republican Party critics now considered a long-shot choice for secretary of state, after naming three polarizing conservatives to fill key national security and judicial posts. Anti-immigration Senator Jeff Sessions, one of Trump&#8217;s earliest supporters during the campaign, was nominated Friday to be attorney general, signaling Trump is prepared to take his hard line on illegal immigration into the White House. To lead the CIA, Trump tapped hawkish Congressman Mike Pompeo, a strident opponent of the Iran nuclear deal and a sharp critic of Trump&#8217;s campaign rival Hillary Clinton during hearings into the 2012 attack on the US mission in Benghazi, Libya. The incoming commander-in-chief also appointed retired lieutenant general Michael Flynn, a top military counsel to the 70-year-old Republican billionaire-turned-world-leader, as his national security advisor. Hours after the picks were revealed, New York state&#8217;s attorney general announced that Trump had reached a $25 million settlement in class action suits accusing his now-defunct Trump University of fraud. The case had been a cloud over his campaign for months, and the deal spares him the embarrassment of further legal wrangling as he forms his government. Attorney Daniel Petrocelli hailed it as a &#8220;victory for everybody.&#8221; In New York, Vice President-elect Mike Pence was booed at a performance of award-winning Broadway musical &#8220;Hamilton,&#8221; whose cast made an unusual on-stage plea for the Trump administration to &#8220;uphold our American values and work on behalf of all of us.&#8221;
