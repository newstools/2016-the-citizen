Ten people died when an overcrowded ferry on the Ugandan side of Lake Albert capsized in strong winds, local police said. The vessel, with 21 people onboard, was taking passengers from Buliisa to Kagoya, farther south, when the accident happened overnight Thursday, Buliisa police spokesman Julius Hakiza told AFP. &#8220;We managed to rescue 11 people. The rest drowned,&#8221; he said. The 10 fatalities comprised six women and four men. Accidents are frequent on the lake, which is shared by Uganda and Democratic Republic of Congo. In March 2014, 210 Congolese refugees drowned when the boat they were travelling in capsized.
