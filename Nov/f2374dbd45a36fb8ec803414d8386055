We are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of lives during a pleasure boat cruise, turned nightmare, on Hartbeespoort Dam, near Pretoria, at the weekend. When the unexpected happens, reason must take its course in the aftermath. But we are also deeply concerned that, from eyewitness accounts, three of the deaths were caused by drowning, as terrified passengers leapt from the pleasure craft into the water to escape the thick smoke and flames emanating from the stern of the vessel. Three of the confirmed deaths came despite attempts at rescuing them from the waters of the dam by about 15 smaller private boats. The fourth was initially put down to a woman trapped in a toilet cubicle of the boat and was overcome as the blaze broke out. It is for an inquiry, which was announced almost immediately, to determine the root cause of the tragedy, which struck end-of-year revellers during what was intended to be an enjoyable outing. But the initial feeling of horror must surely be tempered by the thought that these are deaths that could have very likely been avoided. For among the 203 passengers and staff the operators claim were on board, there were clearly some who could not swim.
