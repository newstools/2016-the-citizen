Sages down history have never failed to remind us that Rome wasn t built in a day! This adage attests to the need for time to create great things. By parity of reasoning, one can safely pontificate that a sturdy, sustainable Economy cannot be built in a day!This business palaver draws from two more-or-less similar backgrounds, in which the President of the 5th-Phase Government of Tanzania, Dr John Pombe Joseph Magufuli (JPM), is directly involved!One is that the President completed one year at the Helm in the Wheelhouse of the Ship of State, Tanzania, last Saturday, November 5, 2016. That s counting from November 5 last year, when he was formally sworn into the Highest Office in the Land as the Head of State and Govt., as well as Chief of the nation s Defence and Security Forces.The other background to this piece is the President s unprecedented offer to take head-on senior members of the mass media fraternity in a Question-and-Answer session at State House in Dar es Salaam on November 4, the eve of his first year anniversary at State House.For about 160 minutes, Dr Magufuli fielded in a live broadcast questions largely based on his performance at the Presidency. These were mostly on the back of his election campaign pledges and the election manifesto of his veteran ruling Party of the Revolution (Chama cha Mapinduzi: CcM), as well as his other public utterances.These last include his address in the National Assembly when inaugurating the 11th Parliament in the quinquennial legislative series, and other public/formal presidential intimations.In the event, questions were raised on issues of national interest and public concern ranging from the political to the socio-economic. Political issues included the need for a new Union Constitution; the separation of Powers (and Privileges) among the three traditional Branches of Govt. (the Executive; Legislature and Judiciary); the perennial Zanzibar political impasse and the concept of Democracy in all its ramifications.In the socio-economic stakes were questions (and answers) on such issues as Press Freedom; industrialization; the inordinately high cost of living vis- -vis falling living standards; Education; Health, Infrastructure and similar developmental products and services That relatively unprecedented State House Q&amp;A Session resulted in a mixed bag of views and feelings from different quarters. There were those who praised the President s responses; those who didn t think the responses were worth a pfenning and the usual societal segment of don t knows, or couldn t care less, about such issues!Perhaps the most surprising bit was Dr Magufuli s denial that he d ever raised the New Constitution issue in his election campaign and, as such, shouldn t be held accountable for its stillbirth! Nor does he seem able, ready and/or willing to pursue same now!A Great Pity, indeed, as a new Constitution based on the Warioba Commission on Constitutional Review was the most practicable and straightforward way to effectively transform the socio-econo-politically-moribund Tanzania into a dynamic, vibrant Democracy!But that and the Zanzibar Political Impasse aside, it must be admitted that the Magufuli Regime has done a lot that s positive. Among these are increased Govt. revenue collections from around Tsh845bn a month when he assumed the Presidency to Tsh1.1trn-plus a year later. Fair enough.But, surely, instead of lavishing scarce public funds on the phantom national air-carrier ATCL, why not direct the still-scarce resources to paying the hundreds of billions of Shillings owed by the Govt. to socio-economic institutions like the power monopoly Tanesco and the Medical Stores Department, pray?Reliable, affordable Energy supplies and a healthy Society are essential to the Industrialisation that President Magufuli is so obsessed with.In all fairness, then, we shouldn t blame/condemn the man so early in his Presidency, but should give him the benefit of the full 5-year term to see if he ll be worth reelecting come the Year-2020 polls Like Rome, EconomiesAren t built in a day or even a year Cheers!
