The City of Ekurhuleni announced on Wednesday that it had set aside R1.7 million for the replacement of a 1.5km problematic underground cables that had been constantly failing and resulting in power outages to areas around Boksburg. The problematic power outages throughout the Boksburg area have been reported many times before. In August, resident Rob Howard wrote to the Boksburg Advertiser describing how residents in Freeway Park and Sunward Park were without electricity for seven hours on July 20, six hours on July 22, four hours on July 23 and six hours on July 25. Howard wrote: &#8220;This is totally unacceptable. I, for one, am on oxygen at night and to have my oxygen switched off so unceremoniously at 4am is very frightening.&#8221; In November last year, a Plantation resident also complained of the unpredictable power outages. Now the City of Ekurhuleni will replace the underground cables in Atlasville, Bartlett and surrounding areas and warned residents that from November 14 to 28, streets in these areas would be opened up to pave the way for the replacement work. Affected streets include Mercury, Star, Venus, Jupiter and Melkweg. &#8220;Technicians will continue to analyse the performance of the electrical distribution network to identify potential weak spots and failing distribution equipment that will be prioritised for the refurbishment work,&#8221; the City&#8217;s statement on the cable replacement read. &#8220;The City of Ekurhuleni apologises for the inconvenience caused and appeals for patience from the residents during this period.&#8221; Caxton News Service
