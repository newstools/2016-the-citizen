Most of South Africa s dam water levels had increased as a result of continuing rainfall, the Water and Sanitation Department said on Tuesday. All dams and catchment systems have benefited from the good rains over the past week. The total volume of water in storage increased this week from 47,9 percent to 48,7, the department said. Gauteng s Vaal dam rose to 31 percent, from 26 last week. Lesotho s Katse Dam, which supplies South Africa with the most water, rose to 39 from 37 percent. Grootdraai near Standerton rose sharply to 72 percent from 65,5, while the Free State s Sterkfontein Dam, used mainly as a reserve, remained at 91 percent. The department released water from Sterkfontein to Vaal Dam two weeks ago as the drought threatened the country s financial capital, Johannesburg. However, some dams were still running low. The North West s Bloemhof Dam was the same as last week at 11 percent.

The Voelvlei Dam dropped from 69 to 67 percent, Berg River to 70 from 71 percent and Theewaterskloof was down from 50 to 48 percent. In the Eastern Cape, the Algoa catchment system with five dams dropped from 67,3 percent to 66. The Amatole catchment system with six dams was at 77 percent average. The Umgeni system in KwaZulu-Natal, with five dams serving Ethekwini metro and Munduzi, rose from 44 to 46 percent. The Nagle River rose from 69 to 72 percent, while the Midmar Dam water level rose from 48 to 50 percent. The Hazelwere rose from 68 percent to 71 and the Pongolapoort upped by more than a point from 18 to 19 percent. The Goedertrouw rose from 18 to 19,6 percent. Hluhluwe upped from 20,9 to 24 percent, while Klipfontein rose slightly from 10,4 to 11,6 percent. Water levels in these three dams are rising but are still low, said the department. Even though there has been a slight increase in dam levels, the Department of Water and Sanitation wishes to advise community members and industries to adhere to water restriction imposed by their respective municipalities. It will take time for the dam levels to reach the normal levels. &#8211; African News Agency
