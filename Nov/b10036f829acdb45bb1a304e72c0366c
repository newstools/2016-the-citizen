The Minister of Public Enterprises Lynne Brown on Wednesday approved a recommendation by the board of Eskom to appoint Matshela Koko as acting group chief executive of the power utility with effect from December 1. Koko is the current head of generation at Eskom after he joined the power utility in 1996 as an engineer-in-training, and moved steadily up the ranks. As the head of generation, Koko holds executive responsibility for coal procurement. His appointment follows the resignation of Brian Molefe earlier this month as group chief executive following his implication in the former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela s State of Capture report. I approved the board s request to appoint Mr Koko as acting Group Chief Executive Officer. Mr Koko has a wealth of experience and understands the challenges Eskom faces. His appointment will also ensure continuity at Eskom, Brown said in a statement. I have also asked the Board to immediately start the process to appoint a permanent Group CEO and that this process needs their urgent attention. Mr Koko must ensure that the current trajectory at Eskom continues. Koko was also implicated in the State of Capture report as he signed a document approving a prepayment of R600,000 to Gupta-owned Tegeta Exploration and Resources, but he was not subpoenaed to give evidence to the public protector.
