By the look of things, Scandal!&#8217;s Hungani Ndlovu, popularly known for playing Romeo, is not just a talented actor and a cute face but also a remarkable dancer, who took dancing classes from some of the best dancers and choreographers in the world, such as Ian Eastwood, WilDaBeast Adams, Parris Goebel, Anze Skrube and Fliistlyz (Chris Brown&#8217;s choreographer) during his three-year stay at America, particularly Los Angeles and New York City. His girlfriend and fellow cast member Stephanie Sandows, who plays Ingrid on the soapie, took to instagram to share her man s other talent with the rest of the world. The 22-year-old actor from Mpumalanga is seen getting down in the video with moves that shocked most on social media.
