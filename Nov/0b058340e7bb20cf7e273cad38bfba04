The bombastic rhetoric and recriminations that have been a feature of the 2016 US presidential campaign are over. Donald Trump will be sworn in as the 45th president of the US after his Democrat opponent, Hillary Clinton, conceded the election. But the billionaire businessman, the first occupant of the Oval Office at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue never to have previously filled a political post or served in the military, knows he now has to deliver. Interestingly, Trump has about three years to turn the promises into a semblance of reality before being sidetracked by the time-consuming interruption of mounting a campaign for re-election. It is a tighter deadline than it might seem at the outset. The president-elect s victory might have stirred the hearts of middle America, but world markets were left in apprehensive turmoil. Stilling the global disquiet must be Trump s burning priority. But that will not be an overnight fix. As a man who understands money, Trump will be aware that the baseline arithmetic shows the US carries a $20 trillion debt and an additional $3 trillion in state and local debt, meaning an $18 trillion economy and a debt-to-GDP ratio of around 125%. In Trump s favour though, are a number of other important factors. As a proven entrepreneur, he will more than likely follow a similar pragmatic approach to policy formulation as 40th US president, Ronald Reagan, appointing experts in their own spheres to tighten the nuts and bolts and managing the resultant process. His Cabinet choices will be crucial. In this, he has the advantage in getting the legislation he wants of having a Republican majority in the House of Representatives and a Republican Senate to back him. One certainty is that we will all shortly be living in interesting times.
