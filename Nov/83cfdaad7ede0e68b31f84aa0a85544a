Zahara&#8217;s wedding plans are going ahead. The songstress is going to have her white wedding in 2017 and it is very likely Top Billing will cover it! Speaking to Times LIVE, Zahara said the story published by Drum magazine that her family had not agreed on lobola with her boyfriend&#8217;s elders is untrue. She said DJ Amaza had paid 20 cows and his family was coming back to settle the amount soon. &#8220;The Ntshanga family came to the house as part of the lobola ceremony. They (Ntshangas) asked how many cows and the prices of cows. These are not just any cows. &#8220;The two families agreed on an amount for lobola. They signed the agreement and, like the tradition goes, the Ntshanga s will be back to make the payment,&#8221; she said. ALSO READ: Zahara may have lied about her boyfriend paying lobola
