A Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) intercampus shuttle bus was burned to ashes in Soshanguve on Sunday. The Stabus student transport was en route from the North to the South campus when students began smelling petrol in the bus, police spokesperson Captain Matthews Nkoadi said. &#8220;When the students went to the driver to report the smell, the bus caught fire. Fortunately the students managed to escape unharmed. The bus was completely engulfed in flames,&#8221; he said. Police were investigating a case of malicious damage to property. &#8220;The cause of the fire doesn&#8217;t appear to be due to a mechanical fault as the fire started inside the bus.&#8221; Meanwhile, TUT Soshanguve students would hold a night vigil on Sunday to oppose the commencement of exams on Monday. South campus South African Students&#8217; Congress Organisation (Sasco) leader Thabang &#8216;Kilo&#8217; Boima said the students demanded exams to be postponed to next year as recent protests interrupted exam preparations. Following ongoing disruptions at both the Soshanguve campuses, TUT announced all students would instead be writing at the Tshwane Events Centre in Pretoria west. Buses would transport all students to the exam venue, the first scheduled to depart at 05h30. &#8220;We cannot be leaving so early in the morning to go write. We also demand to write on the Soshanguve campus and not the Tshwane Events Centre,&#8221; Boima said. rorisangk@citizen.co.za
