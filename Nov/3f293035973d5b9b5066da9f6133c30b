Dar es Salaam. The government has changed the status of seven institutions from Institutes of Education to teachers training colleges due to various challenges.Acting education commissioner in the ministry of Educaiton Nicolas Buretta yesterday named the institutions as Kleruu Teachers College of Iringa, which was initially known as Kleruu Institute of Education, Morogoro-based Dakawa High School, which was known as Morogoro Institue of Education, Patandi (Arusha), which was initially called Patandi Institue of Education, and Butimba (Mwanza), which was firstly known as Nyanza Institute of Education.Also on the list are Kasulu Teachers College, which was known as Lake Tanganyika Institute of Education, Mpwapwa Teachers College that was called Dodoma Institute of Educaiton and Mtwara Teachers College, which was known as Mtwara Institute of Education. These institutions will directly be under the ministry of Education, Mr Buretta said. The colleges had been accorded the higher status in order to increase enrolment of teachers at the university level in the country. The move also followed successful transformation of Chang ombe and Mkwawa as constituent colleges of the Univeristy of Dar es Salaam.Mr Buretta said the process to transform the institutions into institutes of education was not completed due to various challenges that he did not reveal. But he said failure to complete the process had seriously impacted on teachers training in the country. The demotion of the colleges comes a few days after the government isued a circular that banned the Special Advanced Diplomas in Education for Form Four leavers.This programme enabled Form Four leavers, who had gone to teachers training colleges and graduands received teaching certificates, to proceed to acquire teaching diplomas and then enroled for the Special Advanced Diplomas and ultimately join the Univeristy for a special one year degree course.Form Six leavers used to join a university by obtaining first a teaching diploma and then the Special Advanced Diploma before undergoing a one year couse at the university where they were confered with a degree in Education.The circular Number 5 of the ministry of Education issued a fortnight, ago said the programme has been banned and all those holding Special Advanced Diplomas will now have to join the University using either their Form Six creditials or their Teachers Diploma credentials.
