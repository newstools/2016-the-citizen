It is time for this country s rugby Springboks to measure the state of the South African game against themselves after the humiliation of losing to Italy in Florence. Jake White, who orchestrated the Springbok triumph in the 2007 World Cup in France, put Saturday s Test into perspective in his regular column in this newspaper when he said: We should not even dream of losing to Italy. Yet the inevitable happened and the current South African side followed the submissive pattern of losing to Japan in last year s World Cup, being beaten in the first Test of a home series by a patently under-strength Irish side, being little more than tackle dummies in the Rugby Championship, falling face first to England at Twickenham and then bowing the knee to a fired-up Italian combination. The Boks were outmuscled in the tight phases, outthought in attack and generally outmanoeuvered by an Italian side which had come into the match as underdogs but played with all the regal authority of the Doges of old. Clearly, we have become a once-feared rugby nation in sharp decline, seemingly rudderless and uncertain of objectives when they pull the green-and-gold jerseys over their heads. The explanations and excuses have come streaming from Bok coach Allister Coetzee. They are not enough to deflect what has become a growing groundswell of dissatisfaction from this country s increasingly disillusioned fans. Whether Coetzee lasts in his position will probably be decided on how much of a turnaround of our fading fortunes he can engineer in the final tour game against Wales in Cardiff this weekend. Coetzee is responsible for team selections and he must live with that. But undoubtedly the saddest thing is that some real talent within the Bok ranks will suffer collateral damage and in our present circumstances we cannot afford that to happen.
