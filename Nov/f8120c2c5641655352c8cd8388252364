Columnist and blogger Khaya Dlanga was not the only person to liken the elections results in America to the political situation in South Africa on Thursday. He says &#8220;Americans got their own Zuma&#8221; after wealthy American businessman Donald Trump defeated Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Wednesday. Former Cosatu general secretary had earlier asked what would stop Americans voting for Trump when we had voted for Zuma to lead the country for two terms. &#8220;If South Africa voted president Zuma twice why should America not vote president Donald Trump?&#8221; Vavi said on Twitter. National chairperson of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Dali Mpofu said it beat him how people who voted for Zuma after the Nkandla, Marikana and Guptas sagas could now act surprised that Americans had voted for Trump. &#8220;Really beats me how ANYONE who voted for Zuma to be SA President AFTER Nkandla, Marikana, Guptas,etc can judge USA voters for voting Trump!&#8221; he said on Twitter. Western Cape premier Helen Zille continued in the same vein. She said she never understood when South African voters did not &#8220;stop Zuma&#8221;, but news of Trump&#8217;s elections success over Clinton &#8220;is beyond comprehension&#8221;. &#8220;The latest news on the US Election is beyond comprehension. I could never comprehend why SA voters didn&#8217;t &#8216;Stop Zuma&#8217; &#8212; but THIS?&#8221; said the former Democratic Alliance (DA) leader after news broke that Trump had won the elections. Meanwhile, members of parliament (MPs) will take part in a motion of no confidence vote in Zuma brought by the DA. Amid allegations that some disgruntled ANC MPs may abstain from voting so the ANC can lose the vote, ANC top man Mzwanele Manyi has called on all the party&#8217;s MPs to attend parliament today. &#8220;With all the conspiracies doing the rounds, no ANC MP can afford to be sick OR have another engagement more important than parliament today,&#8221; said Manyi.
