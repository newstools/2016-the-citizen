The RS6 recently beat a GT-R around the track, but now it s going after its own family members. In the past few weeks, internet witnesses have seen automotive journalists begin to discover just how impressive the RS6 Performance is. . Based on the A6 Avant, the RS6 fitted with the optional performance package is no hot hatch since its dimensions and the eye-opening weight figure make sure of that. Still, the RS6 Performance packs a gut-punching 445 kW, with the performance package all sent to all four wheels via an eight-speed gearbox. That s a slight bit more than its supercar cousin, the Audi R8. The Spyder we see here may be a bit heavier than its wagon sibling, thanks to chassis reinforcements, but it shouldn t add too much of a burden to the 5.2-litre V10 engine that makes 397 kW. The funny thing is, burdened or not, the RS6 Performance is a hell of a machine that can even challenge a die-hard track machine like the Nissan GT-R. We shouldn t expect the RS6 to pull off the same supercar humiliating trick here, given the R8 s mid-engine handling superiority, but in a straight line, things are different. Thanks to a consistent and intense performance on the part of the RS6 s 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8, things skew in the wagon s favour. Looks like there just might be a replacement for displacement.
