President Jacob Zuma says legal action by two civil society organisations seeking to compel him to institute an inquiry into National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) head Shaun Abrahams and two senior prosecutors, who were involved in the failed prosecution against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, is premature and an abuse of the court process.

Zuma argued that FUL and HSF pursued their high court application knowing fully well he had initiated a process to engage the prosecutors, and that s why he believes the application was premature and irrational. He had asked that he be given the opportunity to perform his constitutional mandate in good faith. Abrahams came under severe criticism last month for announcing his intention to charge Gordhan and two former Sars officials with fraud. At the end of October, however, he withdrew those charges, citing a 2009 memorandum from a legal executive at Sars, which showed that there were no reasons why former Sars deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay could not retire early and be reappointed.

The letters showed that on the day before Abrahams announced the withdrawal of the charges, Ntlemeza expressed his anger at the withdrawal and accused him of not acting in good faith. The application is expected to be heard by a full bench of the court next week.
