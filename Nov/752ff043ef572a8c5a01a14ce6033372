&#8220;Even though I don&#8217;t have a presence on social media &#8212; I think I have made one post ever in my life &#8212; some of the threats of sexual violence and death threats make it through,&#8221; she told the Daily Telegraph. &#8220;They (the abusers) just seem to be faceless cowards and they should be answerable to legislation.&#8221; Carneiro, 43, left Chelsea in September 2015 after being publicly criticised by then manager Jose Mourinho for going onto the pitch to treat a player during a home game against Swansea City. Earlier this year she settled a constructive dismissal case with Chelsea, who apologised &#8220;unreservedly&#8221; over her treatment, and she also reached a discrimination settlement with Mourinho. Carneiro, who now works at her own clinic in London, feels not enough is being done to eradicate sexism in football. &#8220;I think sexism is the least challenged form of discrimination.&#8221; she said. &#8220;Anti-Semitic and other racist comments are widely condemned and I don&#8217;t think that is the case (with sexism) and it begs the question what that leaves room for behind the scenes. &#8220;It is widely accepted that football has a discrimination problem. I really do feel that way, but I think it is the least challenged form of discrimination.&#8221; Carneiro said she had been &#8220;stunned&#8221; by the reactions of male colleagues in the medical profession when she made it clear she wanted to train as a football medic. &#8220;Seeking specialist training in certain sports, male colleagues found that quite surprising,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There was very much a dialogue of bringing attention to my gender or objectifying me in some way. &#8220;They described that as a limit to my career progression in that direction, which I was stunned by. It was a dialogue more appropriate for the 1950s.&#8221;
