Paedophiles, rapists and anyone with a criminal record should not be granted a licence to lead congregations, according to the CRL Commission. The Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Rights Commission (CRL Rights Commission) spent a year investigating the commercialisation of churches after an outcry that some pastors fed congregants snakes, grass and other objects, alleging they were operating under the Holy Spirit. Unlike in the past, commission chairperson Thoko Mkhwanazi-Xaluva said would-be pastors would no longer be allowed to open churches by claiming they were led by the Holy Spirit. They would be required to follow proper processes and obtain a licence to operate as church leaders. The commission released a report with findings yesterday and said there was prima facie evidence of commercialisation of religion and that many people were expected to pay substantial amounts of money before pastors could bless and pray for them.

It remains a serious concern that because of fear or whatever other reason, some religious leaders gave the impression that they are above the law and that no process would affect them, and they would simply contravene any legal framework put in place. In order for a religion to be recognised, it needed to adhere to the prescripts of the proposed law, which includes the formation of a peer-review council, religious peer-review committee and peer-review committee. The peer-review council shall only issue an operating licence once the religious institutions comply with the requirements as stipulated in the proposed Act.&#8221; That no licence may be withheld on the grounds of doctrine unless such doctrine is deemed potentially harmful, physically and mentally to those who practise it, or if such doctrine is not found in the tenets of the religion and which bring the religion into disrepute, read the report.
