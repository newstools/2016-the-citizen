President Jacob Zuma has refuted claims that he is a thief who has fleeced state coffers for his own benefit since assuming office. A defiant Zuma told African National Congress supporters at a cadres forum in Pietermaritzburg on Friday that he was not a thief but knew those who were fleecing state coffers. The truth is I am not a thief and there is no evidence to support this claim. That is why I am not bothered by such accusations. The truth is those who are accusing me of stealing are the ones who are enriching themselves through theft. I know who they are, he said. While not naming them, Zuma promised that at some point he would publish a tell all book which would give a detailed account of the secrets he knew about certain individuals. Long when I am gone, when you are old, you will read in a book what I am referring to right now. Zuma said all the accusations thrown at him did not worry him, as he knew the truth and felt pity for those making remarks about him.
