Don t give cow s milk if your baby younger than one-year as it has less iron and causes small amounts of blood loss from the intestines which makes it harder for the body to absorb iron. When you begin serving your baby solid foods, feed him or her foods with added iron, such as iron-fortified baby cereal.
