It is no secret that Refiloe &#8216;Cassper Nyovest&#8217; Phoolo, or Abuti Fill Up, as he has been calling himself lately, has lost a lot of weight. In fact, Cassper has asked his fans to suggest a new name for him, as he apparently does not qualify as a &#8216;Sexy Chubby Ni**a&#8217; anymore. I need a new name apparently. I still like Sexy Chubby Nigga. What you guys think? pic.twitter.com/HnUFgBp6Ev &mdash; Abuti Fill Up (@CassperNyovest) November 15, 2016 Though some of his fans thought he should keep &#8216;Sexy Chubby Ni**a&#8217;, some called him a traitor for &#8220;betraying&#8221; the &#8220;chubby people&#8217;s club&#8221;. However, some suggested funny names: Ma-Thousand, Idangatye, Mr Game Changer, Sexy Fine ni**a, Sexy King Kong, Chubbynator and Sexy Hunky Ni**a were some of the names his fans suggested to him on Twitter. However, the most hilarious one a fan suggested to him was &#8220;friendzoned ni**a&#8221;, referring to how model Minenhle Dlamini may have &#8216;friendzoned&#8217; Cassper. The Mama I Made It hitmaker has had a crush on Minnie for a while now and makes sure he talks about it every time an opportunity presents itself. In a recent interview with DJ Sbu on his breakfast show, the rapper opened up about his music and the women in his life: his ex-girlfriend Boitumelo Thulo, his mother and crush Minenhle Dlamini. In his music, he has rapped about dating Boity, and even though he never gave her a baby as he said he would, he still thinks she is the best. He has also rapped about marrying Minnie, which is proving to be difficult, as she has a man. Cassper blames Minnie&#8217;s new man for standing in his way of finally dating the girl of his dreams. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s this dude, and I don&#8217;t even know him. I think he&#8217;s a good guy, and I think that&#8217;s maybe what she needs in her life. I think that they have a good relationship going on. But you know, every good things comes to an end, baby.&#8221; Read more: Cassper&#8217;s mom likes Boity, but is impressed with Minnie
