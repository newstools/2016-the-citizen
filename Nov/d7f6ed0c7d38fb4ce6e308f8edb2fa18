&#8220;I can see myself conquering the US, just as I have (conquered) Europe,&#8221; the 35-year-old Swede told daily newspaper Aftonbladet in an interview. &#8220;People stay in one place throughout their entire career, but I have travelled around like Napoleon in Europe and conquered every country I&#8217;ve arrived in,&#8221; Ibrahimovic said. &#8220;So maybe I could cross the Atlantic and conquer the US as well,&#8221; he said after winning the Swedish Golden Ball award for the 11th time on Monday. In honour of the country&#8217;s most prolific goal-scorer, the Swedish football association announced that a statue of Ibrahimovic would be erected at the Friends arena in Stockholm within one year. Acknowledging that United is not in as strong a position as his former team Paris Saint-Germain, Ibrahimovic said he&#8217;s trying to deliver the same results. &#8220;I had it good at PSG; it&#8217;s no secret. We had a strong and good team that got better and better every year,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But that&#8217;s passed now&#8230; This is a new chapter now and I&#8217;m trying to create the same feeling here,&#8221; Ibrahimovic said, referring to United. Noting that United coach Jose Mourinho was one of the reasons he decided to join the Premier League team, Ibrahimovic said: &#8220;I checked the team (United) a little bit before I came and it wasn&#8217;t like the team I came from.&#8221; &#8220;This is something I was prepared for&#8230; the team is not the same as (PSG),&#8221; the superstar said. &#8220;But after speaking with Mourinho, it wasn&#8217;t a difficult decision. If he calls then I have no problems showing up,&#8221; Ibrahimovic added. After a dismal showing at Euro-2016, Sweden&#8217;s all-time high scorer in June put an end to his 116-cap international career, in which he scored 62 goals.
