A Park Rynie home affairs official and a foreign national were arrested for identity fraud on Monday morning, November 7, in KwaZulu-Natal, South Coast Sun reports. Detective Warrant Officer Strini Maistry of Scottburgh police arrested the home affairs official for corruption. The official has been detained and is due to appear in the Scottburgh Magistrates&#8217; Court on Wednesday, 9 November, on a charge of fraud, said police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala. It is alleged the 30-year-old official attended to a foreign national at the Park Rynie home affairs offices in January 2014 and provided him with a fraudulent birth certificate in exchange for a payment of R1 500.

When the foreign national inquired about obtaining a South African identity book, the official informed him he could get one for between R3 500 and R4 000, but he did not follow up on this inquiry. &#8220;Subsequently, the foreign national visited the home affairs offices in Isipingo and applied for a South African identity book. His application was processed, and he was asked to call again to collect his identity book, said Gwala. Home affairs investigators, however, discovered the fingerprints of the applicant for the birth certificate differed from those of the applicant for the identity book. The foreign national was arrested earlier on Monday morning, and he identified the home affairs official from the Park Rynie office as the one who had sold him the fraudulent birth certificate. They knew each other previously, as they had attended the same church and will also appear in court on the same day. &#8211; Caxton News Service &nbsp;
