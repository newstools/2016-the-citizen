It is the third time in less than two months that the fiery Manchester United manager will face disciplinary action from the sport s ruling body. In late October, he was suspended for one game, and fined 8,000 pounds (9,400 euros/$10,000), for an altercation with referee Mark Clattenburg during a draw with Burnley. That incident followed a 50,000-pound punishment for comments made about the decision to allow referee Anthony Taylor to officiate the game with Liverpool. The latest flashpoint also involved a referee with whom Mourinho has recent history. Last season, while in charge of Chelsea, Mourinho had an altercation with the same official in a game at West Ham which resulted in a one-match stadium ban for the Portuguese. A year on, against the same opposition and with the same referee, Mourinho kicked a water bottle fully 20 yards to protest Taylor s decision to caution Paul Pogba for simulation after 27 minutes, a card that rules the French international out of United s League Cup quarter-final tie &#8212; again with West Ham &#8212; at Old Trafford on Wednesday. &#8220;I think everyone saw his frustration was shown in that situation,&#8221; said assistant manager Rui Faria after Mourinho refused to speak post-match. &#8220;It should have been a free-kick for us and it ended with a yellow card for Paul and he is out of our next match. &#8220;So there are maybe reasons to express some frustration. After that, things that are part of the game and the referee took a decision. &#8220;But I think everything comes from a decision that should be the opposite way.&#8221; By that stage Zlatan Ibrahimovic had equalised an early opening goal from Diafra Sakho. But, as has been the norm recently, Mourinho s team could not find a winner as they recorded a fourth consecutive home league draw &#8212; the first time since 1990 they have gone four home games without victory. More worrying yet, United have now recorded their worst start to a season, after 13 games, since 1989-90, the season that saw Sir Alex Ferguson famously win the FA Cup after surviving strenuous calls for his dismissal from supporters. &#8220;We were the best team on the pitch,&#8221; said Faria. &#8220;We didn t have any tactical issues during the game. Defensively we were very compact. Offensively we created the chances to win. &#8220;We are showing that as a team we are a strong side and we can do very good things. We create chances that in a normal way should be goals and the game should be in a comfortable way. &#8220;It is not happening. We get frustrated. The only thing we need to do is keep working because then things will change for us.&#8221; West Ham manager Slaven Bilic sympathised with his opposite number for his latest disciplinary problems. &#8220;I don t know if he deserved to be sent off, I don t know the rules,&#8221; said Bilic. &#8220;I don t want any manager, especially him, to be sent off. It is hard to judge from our angle if it is a dive or a foul so I can understand it but I don t want him to be sent off. &#8220;I have seen him. We didn t talk about the mood but he is a gentleman. I like him.&#8221; But the West Ham manager saw promising signs of recovery in his team s display at Old Trafford. &#8220;It is a difficult season and I am not trying to avoid saying that,&#8221; said Bilic, whose side is just a point above the drop zone. &#8220;I am not happy with the position, we are still paying the price for September, when we had injuries &#8212; lost against Watford, West Brom, Southampton, Middlesbrough. &#8220;But recently there are really good performances from us. It is only a matter of time when we get the points. We could have lost today but still I would say the same thing.&#8221;
