Controversial forensic investigator Paul O&#8217;Sullivan wants top Hawks officials and prosecutors removed from any investigations against him, claiming they were abusing their powers to force him to permanently leave the country. O&#8217;Sullivan this week sought an interim interdict to remove Gauteng Hawks head Major General Prince Mokotedi, two prosecutors and and one of Mokotedi&#8217;s investigators from any investigations or prosecutions against him pending a permanent order for their removal. In the end, the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria merely granted an order confirming an undertaking by National Public Prosecutions Director Shaun Abrahams to give O&#8217;Sullivan 48 hours to present himself at a police station where a warrant had been obtained for his arrest.

His application for the removal of the top Hawks officials from the investigations against him was postponed indefinitely. O&#8217;Sullivan claimed in a lengthy affidavit he was being targeted because of his role in the successful prosecution of the late former Police Commissioner Jackie Selebi and his investigations into alleged fraud and corruption committed by SAA Chairperson Dudu Myeni and numerous other top officials. He claimed he was unlawfully arrested, kept in custody under appalling circumstances which amounted to &#8220;torture&#8221; for several days and that &#8220;baseless&#8221; investigations were being revived against him to prevent him from exposing corrupt activities and that his life was in danger. He alleged Mokotedi had a long history of animosity towards him and was persecuting him because he had laid criminal charges against the general and some of the people in his team and instituted a R1,5 million defamation claim against Mokotedi. Mokotedi has accused O&#8217;Sullivan of being an agent of a foreign intelligence agency &#8211; a claim O&#8217;Sullivan strenuously denied. Deputy Public Prosecutions Director Jabulani Mlotshwa said in an affidavit O&#8217;Sullivan had been warned that some of the allegations against him were so serious that warrants for his arrest were unavoidable. This included a complaint of treason, a complaint laid by Dudu Myeni and one relating to a court judgment in which a judge described O&#8217;Sullivan as &#8220;a self-appointed vigilante&#8221; whose conduct in one of his investigations amounted to attempted extortion. He said the investigations against O&#8217;Sullivan had been centralized to promote efficiency.
