 Moshi. Tanzanians in the Diaspora have been urged to promote the country s tourist attractions and invest back home. By investing in Tanzania, they will improve livelihoods of their compatriots by creating job opportunities, according to former Prime Minister Cleopa Msuya. Mr Msuya observed that the country is endowed with numerous tourist attractions, but there isn t enough marketing of the resources abroad. He also advised authorities in Kilimanjaro Region to provide platforms through which those in the Diaspora can contribute their expertise, especially in agriculture. Kilimanjaro has the potential of being the country s food basket in the next few years, but for us to maximise in this potential we have to fully engage those in the Diaspora, he said, adding: There are many opportunities being offered in the region (Kilimanjaro). To me, commercial farming, tourism, industries and service sector should be preferred, he added. Mr Msuya, who is also a former MP Mwanga, made the remarks over the weekend when addressing the Kilimanjaro Development Forum (KDF), a platform established recently to push for the speedy socio-economic development of the region. Mr Msuya, who is the KDF chairman, called upon development stakeholders and those with good intentions for Kilimanjaro wherever they are to mobilise resources for the implementation of development projects in the region, including reviving collapsed factories. He further noted that there were many people from Kilimanjaro living overseas, who can play a key role in wooing foreign investors and tourists to the region. A five-year strategic plan for the economic development in the region was launched during the meeting. The meeting was attended by a number of private sector representatives.
