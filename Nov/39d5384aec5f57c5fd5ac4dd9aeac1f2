If a report in the Sunday Times is to be believed, then outgoing African Union Commission chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma was among those VIPs who visited the Guptas&#8217; Saxonwold home in 2010 or 2011. Her visit was allegedly recorded in the logbook of a former driver for the Gupta family, John Maseko, who also provided reporters with his notes to reveal a list of other state officials who paid visits to the family. Maseko only worked for the Guptas for a period of six months, from November 2010 to April 2011 (more&#8217;s the pity), but it&#8217;s understood President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s visits to the compound, along with the apparent summoning of other senior state officials, continued in much the same vein for the years thereafter. Of course, the compound is not an actual &#8220;shebeen&#8221;, though that&#8217;s an appellation that will doubtlessly stick around now since Eskom CEO Brian Molefe tried to muddy the waters last week about there being some sort of mysterious illegal mystery drinking hole in the northern suburbs. Of course there&#8217;s no such shebeen, and of course Molefe was nothing other than a regular visitor to the Gupta compound. Ajay Gupta even told Thuli Madonsela how chummy they are, and that he considers Molefe &#8220;a brother&#8221;. It&#8217;s curious that Molefe seems to be so uncomfortable with admitting this. After all, it&#8217;s a free country. Anyone can go and visit anyone at their home whenever they like. There&#8217;s no law against being friends with the Guptas, phoning them 60 times a month and going for tea or a quart of Zamalek at their house. All the same, we know why people are suddenly so nervous to admit after the third crowing of the rooster at dawn that they even know there is such a family as the Guptas. The way people are reacting to the Guptas now, you&#8217;d think there was Act 72 of 2001 Prohibiting All Contact with the Guptas. It&#8217;s as if saying &#8220;you visited the Guptas!&#8221; has become the ultimate slander. &#8220;No! I would never do such a thing!&#8221; While there isn&#8217;t any such law, it&#8217;s more probable Molefe is aware of the laws governing conflict of interest, which is why he&#8217;s wishing there really was a shebeen in Saxonwold, and that he had in fact been going there instead. Which brings me to the question of whether we need to be concerned that Dlamini-Zuma was a Gupta guest in 2010/11. It leads us to wonder whether there could ever conceivably be a future for this country that didn&#8217;t somehow involve big decisions being decided by those businessmen in Saxonwold. Between Dlamini-Zuma and Ramaphosa, whose spokesperson also visited the Guptas during the period, which of them is more likely to be &#8220;captured&#8221; by the Guptas? I honestly don&#8217;t know, but the family links of Dlamini-Zuma&#8217;s are the more probable cause for concern and it&#8217;s certainly very unlikely Ramaphosa could be lured by R600,000 cash in a bag considering he&#8217;s a billionaire already. (On that point, one can only wonder in astonishment at that little detail that Ajay Gupta apparently asked Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas if he had his own bag to receive his cash bribe. Do they run bribes in Saxonwold the way Shoprite runs its check-out counters? But never mind&#8230;) It&#8217;s probably unlikely that we&#8217;ll be able to find a future leader in the ANC who can&#8217;t be linked back to the Guptas in some way. Nor for one moment am I suggesting that the family is the only entity that&#8217;s been trying to exert undue influence over the state. It&#8217;s an old, old problem. Let&#8217;s not even start talking about the Oppenheimers, the Kebbles, the Ruperts, and so on. It would be great if very clear boundaries regarding the influence of business and conflicts of interest were drawn up and made more concrete in the wake of this whole State of Capture report. The same stringent rules against undue influence by the Guptas would then have to be applied in the case of ALL other businesses and businesspeople all those horrible construction cartels, for example, who fleeced us in the building of World Cup stadiums, for example, would be a nice place to start. And people in government have been organising contracts for their buddies without following proper procedure for as far back as I can remember ever reading a newspaper, before I even knew there was such a name as &#8220;Gupta&#8221;. If the Guptas have been trying to capture us and milk us, then sure, it&#8217;s a problem. But let&#8217;s not pretend the problem of state capture will suddenly go away even if the Guptas disappear completely. The Guptas are not really our problem. It&#8217;s the susceptibility and willingness of our state to hand over our sovereignty to anyone other than government that&#8217;s the problem. Perhaps it&#8217;s the character of Zuma himself that needs to be questioned. Had it not been the Guptas, I suspect there would have been another family or individual who would have found undue favour from him. Remember Schabir Shaik? I can&#8217;t tell you which of the two between Dlamini-Zuma or Ramaphosa is less likely to be &#8220;captured&#8221;. Perhaps both of them already are, by whoever their particular version of the Guptas will turn out to be. Personally, I truly hope not, because I&#8217;m not sure I could stand another five or 10 years of wondering who&#8217;s really in charge of the country.
