Rikhado Makhado, better known by his stage name Riky Rick but lately changed to King Kotini, has never really been shy to show his affection for his woman and child on social media, and the Sidlukotini hitmaker has decided to wear his heart on his sleeve again today. The talent went on Instagram to share with his many followers a picture of his bae and his cute son and thanked the two, who he regards as his angels , for loving him dearly. All I ever needed was somebody who could accept me as I am. Somebody who could be patient, loving and genuine. I looked and looked everywhere but found nothing. The moment I had given up, God sent me some angels, he captioned the picture, adding that the two are the best gift he has ever received. I am not a perfect man. I have my faults, but knowing that I have such a beautiful family to raise makes me a better man. I love you guys. Thank you for loving me. The musician, actor, and record producer further explained his well wishes for other people. I wish each and every one of you the feeling of your own family, he jotted down. The 29-year-old was born in KwaMashu, KwaZulu-Natal. His debut studio album Family Values was released on April 3 last year.
