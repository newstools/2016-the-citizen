The suspension handed down by Safa on Bafana Bafana coach Shakes Mashaba which will keep him off the touchline for tonight s friendly international against Mozambique, points to two things. The first is that there are growing divisions within Safa, who have admitted to being cash strapped, blaming much of this predicament on the costly business of sending both men s and women s teams to the Rio Olympics. The question of sound financial governance should surely be raised in this regard. Secondly, according to the pundits, it highlights a groundswell of feeling that Mashaba has lost the confidence of the ruling body of soccer in this country and has been shown that he is on the way out. His alleged crime? Heatedly pointing fingers at Safa president Danny Jordaan. Without anticipating any further disciplinary measures Safa may implement, it must be said in Mashaba s defence that he is a passionate man, who lives and breathes football. This passion has often boiled over into unseemly rants against the nearest target, be it administrators, the media or even the players. But if football is to be played in a barren, pragmatic wasteland without the passion which is so much part of it, the game surely ceases to be beautiful.
