Idols SA judge and choreographer Somizi Mhlongo has taken to Instagram to share with his fans what they can use Doom for, apart from killing cockroaches. In a video he recently posted, he told fans that Doom would change their lives and sexuality. &#8220;One is to make you straight for all the homosexuals and [for] all the stabanes all over the world, I have a product that will help you.&#8221; Not only will Doom change one&#8217;s sexuality, according to Somizi&#8217;s rather unique sense of humour, it will also help all the single ladies who are in need of a life partner. It &#8220;will bring all your men and luck and they will live happily ever after&#8221;. Watch the video below: LaDoomizulu.

One is to make you straight for all the homosexuals and [for] all the stabanes all over the world, I have a product that will help you. &#8220;Also for all you ladies that don&#8217;t have men, there is a product for you that will bring all your men and luck, and they will live happily ever after. Guess what the product is &#8230; ladies and gentlemen, I introduce this [Doom] to you; for the gays, this will make you straight. Dumisa inkosi (praise the Lord), Amen.&#8221; As Somizi was the one who was telling fans what else they could do with Doom, his colleague Unathi Msengana became the target of a Doom meme.
