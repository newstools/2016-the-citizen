Leave me out of this nonsense! https://t.co/XUPefp9dE2 &mdash; Khaya Mthethwa (@khayamthethwa) November 14, 2016 Khumalo on Monday night also took to Twitter to deny reports claiming she was pregnant with Mthethwa&#8217;s baby, calling the reports &#8220;hurtful&#8221;. &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand why or how people can be so hurtful. I am not dating anyone, I am not pregnant,&#8221; she said on Twitter, further saying she was not &#8220;your social media toy&#8221;. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been so busy promoting my new album My Truth around the country that I&#8217;ve hardly had time to myself. What I find most concerning are the comments on social media on this fabricated issue from women. &#8220;I would like to categorically state that I am not dating anyone at the moment. Khaya Mthethwa is an industry friend who I happened to take a selfie with at a show we were both working on. I am not pregnant with anyone&#8217;s child,&#8221; she said in a statement. Khumalo&#8217;s management agency said they were aware of the rumours doing the rounds and would take legal action against the site that ran the story.
