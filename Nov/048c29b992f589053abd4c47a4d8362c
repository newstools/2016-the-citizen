It s a well-known rule that you shouldn t wear white to a wedding if you are not the bride, unless the theme is all-white of course, which was certainly not the case at former Bafana Bafana midfielder Kagisho Dikgacoi and his new wife Carina Mckechnie white wedding recently. Nonetheless, former Miss South Africa Bokang Montjane-Tshabalala arrived with her man, South African professional football midfielder, Siphiwe Tshabalala, wearing a white dress that looked pretty much like a wedding dress at the prestigious wedding. The beauty, who received a lot of criticism from social media for pulling such a stunt at another woman s wedding, recently went to social media to defend herself and explain the exact colour of her dress.

Regardless, some people still went on social media to voice their disapproval of the dress, indicating that the former Miss SA was somehow trying to outshine another woman on a day that wasn t hers. I would just unfriend @bokang_m shes disrespectful wearing white at ur wedding worse a dress that looks like a wedding dress, one person wrote. Was this a double wedding, another asked, while some defended Montjane-Tshabalala and pointing out how beautiful she looked. We are no experts when it comes to wedding attires, and we don t know if the model spoke to the bride first about her outfit. What do you think of her dress choice?
