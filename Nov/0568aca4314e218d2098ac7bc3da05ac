When the international rugby fixtures for 2016 were compiled earlier this year, few people would have thought today s encounter between the Springboks and Italy in Florence would take on such great significance. Italy are ranked 13th in the world, the Springboks fourth. When the fixtures were released earlier this year, South Africa s ranking would have even been better, but a dismal run of just four wins from 10 internationals in 2016 under coach Allister Coetzee has meant South African rugby is at a crossroads. What s even more worrying for Springbok supporters is that South Africa could have so easily lost all four of those matches they eventually won. If South Africa are to salvage anything out of this lacklustre year, they need to beat Italy today and beat the home side convincingly. Coetzee resisted the temptation to make wholesale changes this week after being thumped 37-21 by England at Twickenham last weekend and, instead, brought in veteran winger Bryan Habana to boost continuity in the side. With Wales looming next week, the Boks need to find some much-needed rhythm in Florence if they are to end the year with a little credibility and help keep the vultures circling Coetzee at bay. The Azzurri are also on the back foot after the mighty All Blacks smashed them 68-10 last weekend, so the Boks are rightfully the favourites. Italy have not beaten the Springboks in 12 previous encounters. South Africa will be hoping it is not a case of lucky number 13 for the Italians.
