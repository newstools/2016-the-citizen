Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom who made a call for President Jacob Zuma s removal from office at the weekend was greeted by cheers and silence when he made his appearance in parliament on Tuesday following the ANC s heated national executive committee (NEC) meeting.

Hanekom reportedly walked into the assemble during a vote by MPs for the appointment of the inspector-general of intelligence, and, according to the House rules, the doors had to be closed. With a smile on his face, Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) chief whip Narend Singh asked Tsenoli why he chased Hanekom out. I expected such a question, replied Tsenoli humorously. This apparently led to the voting process being restarted, with the minister returning to cries of Viva Hanekom! Viva! from the EFF benches and applause from the DA MPs, although there was no reaction from ANC members. During the governing party s extended national executive committee (NEC) meeting in Pretoria at the weekend, Hanekom brought a surprise motion of no confidence against Zuma. However, the NEC resolved that it would build towards unity in the liberation movement instead of recalling the president.

We will support you here. Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi, who s understood to have backed Hanekom s motion, was also present, but Thulas Nxesi and Naledi Pandor, who are also alleged to have spoken out against Zuma, were absent.
