Musician Dr Malinga has released what he calls Doom song: Part I after a Limpopo &#8220;prophet&#8221; recently made headlines for using Doom to &#8220;heal&#8221; congregants. In a video Malinga posted on Instagram, he is riding in his car while praying in tongues. We can hear &#8220;raba Doom&#8221; and issues such as unemployment and sickness being mentioned in his prayer. Perhaps he should have asked followers to type &#8216;Amen&#8217; in the comments section to get their blessings.
