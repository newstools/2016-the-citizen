Dar es Salaam. Commercial banks are taking a cautious lending approach as they seek to align their operations with the prevailing economic situation amid a tight liquidity stance.Apart from a decision by the government to transfer up to Sh600 billion - held in commercial banks by ministries, public corporations and local government authorities to the Bank of Tanzania (BoT) thereby adversely affecting the liquidity positions, the level of loan defaults is also high in the market, forcing financial institutions to devise their business strategies.Going by the BoT s latest Monthly Economic Review (MER), commercial banks credit to the private sector has been going down, with the manufacturing and the building and construction sectors being the highest casualties.For instance, during the year ending August 2016, credit to the private sector by banks grew at a minimal annual rate of 13.8 per cent, lower than 24.1 per cent registered in the corresponding period in 2015. The slower growth was attributed to a more cautious lending approach adopted by banks as part of their risk mitigation measures, in an attempt to adjust to government actions of streamlining fiscal operations, the BoT says in its September 2016 MER.According to the report, while loans granted to individuals (personal loans) and trade increased slightly, the growth was lower in agriculture and transport and communication while the manufacturing and the building and construction sectors registered declines in loans received.Credit to the manufacturing sector declined by -13.3 per cent while building and construction registered a -0.8 per cent decline in credit.Commercial banks believe it was unfortunate that the decision came abruptly without giving them a chance to prepare for the aftermath. Basically, the decision was good though it has affected our operations because the government did not prepare us before deciding .it would be fine if the money was to be transferred on quarterly basis instead of transferring the entire amount within a short period, said a source from one of the international banks, preferring anonymity.Analysts are of the view that the existing scenario calls for more innovation by commercial banks with a view to finding alternative ways of sourcing deposits instead of depending easy money . What we have seen during the past few months clearly reflects the fact that commercial banks were not transparent enough in their dealings .they should now become innovative in sourcing for deposits instead of relying on government securities, said Prof Delphin Rwegasira of the Economics Department of the University of Dar es Salaam.By being innovative, commercial banks will be expected to start raising their interest rates on fixed deposits so as to attract more funds from depositors which they may use to loan to the productive sector.The challenge, he said, is that commercial banks have been caught unaware by the government s decision to become more transparent in its dealings. A crackdown on corruption including on ghost workers means that ambiguous deals that used to earn some banks some deposits are no longer available. This tells us that even the growth in credit to some private sector operations that we used to witness in the past were destined for opaque operations so with a change in government style, commercial banks must become more transparent and innovative as well, he said.The general manager for Dun &amp; Bradstreet Credit Bureau Tanzania Ltd, Mr Adebowale Atobatele shared similar sentiments: Going by what is happening in the market, commercial banks must now work towards mobilising their customers deposits so they can have enough money to issue as loans they should also create public awareness about the importance of saving and repaying the loans, he said.According to the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE) manager for projects and business development, Patrick Mususa, the government s decision was right and may have been influenced by the fact that the country has several ways that companies can use to raise capital, including through the stock market.Similar sentiments were echoed by the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Works, Transport and Communication, Prof Faustine Kamuzola who urged commercial banks to undertake a comprehensive public awareness campaign with a view to educating the public regarding the need and benefits of keeping their money in banks.Additional Reporting by Alfred Zacharia
