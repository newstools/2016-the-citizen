Two days into his four-day stint as finance minister in December last year, Des van Rooyen&#8217;s newly appointed advisory team reportedly took it upon itself to share confidential Treasury information with close associates of the Gupta family. This revelation is contained in the Sunday Times, which says it has seen &#8220;shocking details&#8221; revealed in a &#8220;string of e-mails&#8221;. They claim Van Rooyen&#8217;s advisers Ian Whitley and Mohamed Bobat were trying to take over Treasury &#8220;almost immediately&#8221;. Whitley is ANC deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte&#8217;s son-in-law. The emails emerged in the ongoing court battle between Gupta-aligned businessman Eric Wood and his former partners at Regiments Capital. At the centre of the dispute is Wood&#8217;s decision to leave Regiments and partner with a key business partner of the Guptas&#8217; and President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s son Duduzane, Salim Essa. Among the information Van Rooyen&#8217;s advisers sent to the Gupta-aligned businesspeople was breakdowns of government expenditure and information relating to ratings agencies. A senior government official said the leak was a &#8220;serious breach&#8221;. The emails were sent to Wood, Bobat&#8217;s former boss. Wood is now the CEO of Trillian Capital Partners, which is owned by Essa and chaired by former minister Tokyo Sexwale. Sexwale announced earlier this month that he had asked Advocate Geoff Budlender to investigate allegations that Trillian and Wood may have been involved in attempts at state capture. That investigation is continuing. Trillian told the Sunday Times in a statement that the matter of the emails was part of its investigation, which was &#8220;highly disputed&#8221;. Revelations that Wood somehow already knew in October 2015 that then finance minister Nhlanhla Nene would be removed in December rocked the country, especially in light of further allegations that Wood and Essa were allegedly trying to influence Van Rooyen to champion a number of initiatives they favoured. Nene&#8217;s axing rocked financial markets and cost the economy as much as R500 billion.
