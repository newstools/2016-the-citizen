 Malema is playing with fire. Land owners, especially the white people he is so fond of mentioning, will not hesitate to protect themselves, their families and their land within the framework of the law, says Ian Cameron, AfriForum s head of community safety. This after leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Julius Malema called on members of the public to occupy whatever land they wanted, even if it was privately owned. He also intimated that white people would eventually be &#8220;slaughtered&#8221; if they continued to own land illegitimately. Addressing a group of EFF supporters outside the Bloemfontein Regional Court on Monday, where he was appearing on charges of inciting land grabs, Malema reiterated that &#8220;if you see a beautiful land, and you like it&#8221;, occupy it. AfriForum &#8220;plans on increasing intensity by establishing even more safety structures in 2017&#8221;. The civil-rights organisation says the constitution provides that property belonging to persons needs to be protected. They have called on the South African Police Service (SAPS) to &#8220;act in terms of the Constitution&#8221; against anyone who incites land grabs. In terms of the Trespass Act of 1959, the SAPS must ensure action against squatting and that inciters are criminally charged and prosecuted, says Cameron. South Africans have a democratic right to protect themselves and their property, and we must take ownership of this right. People shouldn t panic, but should rather act proactively by joining safety structures such as neighbourhood watches. While addressing the EFF crowd in Bloemfontein, Malema launched a scathing attck on AfriForum, calling them &#8220;a group of Afrikaners&#8221; who still wished South Africa was under apartheid. &#8220;AfriForum is a boeremag. It&#8217;s a group of Afrikaners who still wish for apartheid. They will never see it. Afrikaner boys! Die poppe sal dans. &#8220;The EFF is coming for you boys. Afrikaner boys! The ANC has made you to feel that this thing [province] is still the Orange Free State. This thing is not the Orange Free State. When we take over power, Afrikaner males, you will know your place.&#8221;
