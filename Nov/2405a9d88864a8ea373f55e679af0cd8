An expert has revealed how the fuel industry has apparently been smiling all the way to the bank while South African consumers are paying billions for the hidden costs emanating from the sector s refusal to upgrade its outdated oil refineries that dirty fuel. Independent agricultural economist Fanie Brink said oil companies have for many years not invested in upgrading their old refineries. He said the phasing out and reduction of the lead and sulphur content in fuels cost the consumer billions of rands, which was not necessary if refineries were upgraded. Brink was responding to KPMG s study report released in Johannesburg on Thursday on the impact of the petroleum industry on the country s economy. The oil companies expect government to make the fuel consumer responsible for the costs of the upgrading, Brink said. He said the oil industry has, in fact, reached an impasse with the government on the investments needed to produce cleaner fuels due to the fact it is expensive. They expect government to compel motorists to provide the capital by increasing taxation on fuel, but, worst of all, the oil companies, as in the past, again want a return on this capital. Brink says the consumer pays virtually all the costs for the importing and refining of crude oil
