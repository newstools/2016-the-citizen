In a continued debate about Willem Oosthuizen and Theo Martins Jackson, the two white farmers who assaulted Victor Rethabile Mlotshwa by forcing him into a brown coffin at JM De Beer Boerdery, politicians have come out to share their thoughts on the incident. Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane said on Twitter: &#8220;Waiting for the two #coffincase people who act in despicable manner against the South Africa we ought to build. Racism must be destroyed.&#8221; While some commended Maimane for speaking out against racism, Minister of Sports and Recreation Fikile Mbalula did not buy the &#8220;act&#8221;. &#8220;You kept an MP that praised P.W Botha in your DA caucus. Botha did far worse inhumane things. SusActela Ntate Mfundisi c&#8217;mon, Please,&#8221; said the sports minister. You kept an MP that praised P.W Botha in your DA caucus. Botha did far worse inhumane things. SusActela Ntate Mfundisi c&#39;mon, Please ! https://t.co/o0TlFIcSq5 &mdash; RSA Min of Sport (@MbalulaFikile) November 16, 2016 Mbalula was referring to former DA MP Dianne Kohler Barnard, who was expelled from the party for sharing a Facebook post by journalist Paul Kirk, who wrote: Please come back PW Botha you were far more honest than any of these [African National Congress] rogues, and you provided a far better service to the public. For this reason, Mbalula thinks Maimane should not go around condemning racist acts in public when &#8220;Botha did far worse inhumane things&#8221;. &#8220;The #coffinAlive case was captured on camera. How many such inhumane acts happen far from the glare of cameras. Very sad and painful.&#8221; However, Maimane&#8217;s supporters came to his rescue, slamming Mbalula for having the audacity to speak out against what he thought was wrong in DA when he could not address issues in his own party. &#8220;Better than not standing up against a president that&#8217;s currently destroying the nation,&#8221; one follower said. Others advised him to stick to sports, while some said he should have kept quiet, as the discussion was about &#8220;serious matters that affect the country and not one-night stands&#8221;. Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) national spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, who retweeted Maimane, also spoke out against the assault and further slammed the Middelburg Magistrates&#8217; Court for &#8220;wanting to hide the identity of the perpetrators&#8221; after they refused media coverage of the case. The party further condemned the apparent difference in treatment between the two cases. &#8220;Mcebo Dlamini, arrested and chained for asking for Free Education while White Racists who attempted murder roam free with no chains!&#8221; They were referring to the pictures circulating on social media showing the two farmers walking in to the court without any cuffs while Dlamini had ankle cuffs.

In the video, two men can be seen assaulting a man who has been identified as Mlotshwa. One of the two men can be seen in the video forcing the seemingly terrified Mlotshwa into a brown coffin. The incident caused an outcry countrywide and has seen political parties the ANC, DA, and EFF intervening. The parties marched to the court, where both accused were appearing. The two have withdrawn their applications for bail in apparent fear of the angry community of Middelburg.
