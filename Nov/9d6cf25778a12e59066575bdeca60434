We hoped that they would have finished a bit higher on the table, but it was a difficult tournament and we are satisfied that our golfers gained the needed exposure, said Tango. We can t blame them for finishing fourth, instead, we encourage them to use the experience they gained to perform better in the forthcoming competitions. We have a good crop of budding golfers and what is needed now to nurture them to realise their full potential.
