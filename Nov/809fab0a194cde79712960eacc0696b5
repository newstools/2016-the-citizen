The Rhodes Park rape and murder trial has received wide publicity, but on Thursday the public gallery in the High Court sitting in Palm Ridge was completely empty save for four journalists. The highly publicised attack on two women who were sexually assaulted and raped by a gang while on a stroll with their husbands in the Rhodes Park in October last year didn t attract any audience. The horrific attack culminated in the gang forcing the women s husbands into the lake, where they drowned. During a break in court proceedings, the African News Agency (ANA) asked prosecutor Monde Mbaqa why the court was empty, and he responded: This was just an ordinary case, and I don t understand why the media even got an interest in it. The widows, who survived the ordeal, have not been to court since they testified about the horrific attack. Mbaqa said the case is very traumatising for the widows, so it won t be advisable to call them to come to court because every time when they see the accused they would be reminded of the tragic incidents. Three men, Thabo Nkala, 25, Admore Ndlove, 23, and Mduduzi Lawrence Mathibela, 32 who were allegedly part of the 12-man gang that attacked the couples are on trial for robbery, rape and murder.
