Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa will on Sunday release the report of the panel of advisors appointed to advise the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac) on the level at which South Africa s national minimum wage should be set. This would be during Nedlac s Committee of Principals (CoP) meeting comprising of leaders labour, business, government, and communities and would include members of the advisory panel chaired by Professor Imraan Valodia, the presidency said in a statement on Saturday. The report of the panel will be tabled at the meeting. The report discusses or deals with what the national minimum wage for South Africa should be. It is a proposal and that proposal contains the figure, the magical figure that everybody has been waiting for will be out on Sunday, Ramaphosa said in the statement We will discuss it and we will then publicise it on Sunday and thereafter it will be discussed across the length and the breadth of the nation. It will also deal with the mechanics of how it is and once accepted, how it is going to work and how it will change over time and when it will be implemented. We will also be dealing with issues of labour stability, protracted strikes, [and] violence during strikes. Hopefully we will be able to finalise the agreement soon thereafter. These are just proposals but much more concrete proposals, I must say, which will still need to be taken back to various social partners in their various components. The government will discuss it within government circles, Cabinet, as well, as well as the unions in their own executives. It is an exciting moment for all the social partners who have been involved in these discussions because we are now recording real meaningful progress; it is no longer just words, there is something concrete on the table now, Ramaphosa said.
