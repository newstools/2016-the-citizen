Investigations are under way after a man allegedly shot and killed his wife before turning the gun on himself in Section C, Mamelodi West, in Pretoria. It is alleged a man and his wife had been arguing when the man grabbed his gun, shot his wife then turned the gun on himself on Friday, Rekord East reported. The couple s 15-year-old son was the first to witness the scene and alerted neighbours. Their three-year-old was also in the house at the time. Police spokesperson Captain Johannes Maheso said it appeared the man had fired several shots at his wife then committed suicide. He said the police had been called by neighbours who had been alerted by the boy. By the time paramedics and the police arrived [on the scene], the couple was already dead, said Maheso. The couple s bodies were taken to the government mortuary. It is unclear what the couple was arguing about. The Mamelodi West police have opened a docket for the murder and inquest, said Maheso, adding the children would receive counselling. The police could not confirm the couple s ages. &#8211; Caxton News Service
