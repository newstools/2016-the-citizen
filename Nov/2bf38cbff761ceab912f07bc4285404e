When it comes to stakes races we are always told to go with the best handicapped runner. However, there are times when those horses are not distance suited and one has to look elsewhere. That is the case in Race 8 over 1200m at Flamingo Park today. Lebeoana is the best weighted horse but he would need at least another 600m to show his best. Dukes Idol is next best but if he is contender then one needs to look at Red Special, on a line through Seattle Sunset, should have the edge over Dukes Idol. Trained by Stephanie Miller, Red Special is unbeaten in two starts over the course and distance. Last time, over 1600m, he was run out of it late by Seattle Sunset, going down 0.50 lengths at level weights. Over 1400m and getting 3kg, Dukes Idol beat Seattle Sunset by a head. He is only getting 0.5kg from Red Special and over this shorter trip, Bill Human&#8217;s charge should battle to beat the son of Kahal. Gunter Wrogemann takes the ride on Red Special yet again.
