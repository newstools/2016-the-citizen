Economic Freedom Fighters supporters gathered at Batho township in Bloemfontein on Sunday night for a night vigil ahead of party leader Julius Malema s appearance in a local court. An EFF-branded truck had arrived earlier at the Batho community hall, blasting revolutionary songs as supporters trickled in, arriving in buses and cars. Local EFF officials said they expected more than 2000 people to join the vigil. Malema faces charges relating to the alleged contravention of the Riotous Assemblies Act, which prohibits gatherings that might be deemed a public disruption by the State. The State charged that in December 2014, Malema called on people to occupy vacant land during the EFF elective conference in Bloemfontein, where he was elected EFF president.

The 35-year-old Malema appeared in the Newcastle Magistrate s Court on November 7. The case was postponed after Malema sought to lodge an application with the Constitutional Court to have the apartheid-era act and the charges levelled against him declared unconstitutional. On Monday morning, supporters will march from Batho to the Bloemfontein Magistrate s Court in the CBD where they will demonstrate outside court as Malema appears inside. African News Agency (ANA)
