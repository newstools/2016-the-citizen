Kampala. Uganda Cranes striker Emmanuel Okwi has distanced himself from reports that he has signed a deal with his former club, Simba SC.The Sonderjyske forward has been linked with a move to his club with media reports in Tanzania and Kenya describing the deal as good as done. In a brief interview with Kawowo Sports, Okwi, who enjoyed two stints at the Msimbazi, quashed everything. It s not true, he said. I have also merely heard the rumours, he added.The former SC Villa forward went further to deny any agreement and revealed he is not in communication with officials from Simba as alleged. There is nothing agreed upon and I am not in communication with Simba, he said. Okwi left the club last year for Denmark, but has struggled to earn playing time at Sonderjyske. (Kawowo)
