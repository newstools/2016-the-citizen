The South African military ombudsman is on an extensive outreach campaign, urging communities to speak out if they have grievances against the official conduct of current and former members of the South African National Defence Force. You should remember that this office is new and that is why we are on an outreach programme to visit all military units, said the ombud, retired Lt-General Themba Matanzima, in Pretoria. We will also visit all executive mayors because some people, when they are frustrated, they go to the mayors.&#8221; It is our responsibility to talk to almost everybody.&#8221; Many people, said Matanzima, did not know the ombudsman. We are engaged in a programme to make presentations so that they can know that there is this office, if you have some issues regarding the conduct of soldiers. Matanzima said the office of the military ombud, which is four years old, provided an independent mechanism to deal with complaints and grievances. The role of the ombud s institution is to gather facts in order to understand the merits of a complaint and thereafter, to consult all relevant parties to either settle the complaint or to make a recommendation to resolve the complaint, said Matanzima. An ombudsman s investigation is not a criminal investigation, nor is it meant to be an adversarial process. It is rather an administrative inquiry to ensure due process has been observed. Matanzima said the military ombud did not represent the complainant, the department of defence or any government authority, but was rather an independent, impartial third party . African News Agency
