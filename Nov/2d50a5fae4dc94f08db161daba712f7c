The national department of public works (NDPW) on Tuesday, denied polluting the Jukskei River, which has reportedly resulted in the contamination of the Hartbeespoort Dam. As the NDPW, we are especially concerned as the property in question is under the custodianship of the Department. Joburg Water, an entity of the City of Joburg, has a municipal out-fall sewer line that crosses the prison premises, running parallel to the Jukskei River, the department said in a statement. It is our understanding that one of the out-fall sewer lines has been decommissioned to resolve blockages in the line. This has resulted in spillages into the Jukskei River. Two out-fall sewer lines from Bruma and Midrand areas adjoin in a sewer line passing through the Leeuwkop Prison on its way to the Northern Works Wastewater Treatment Plant.

The department said that it received a notice from the Department of Water and Sanitation to also address the matter of the plant in the piggery which was designed to convert piggery sewage sludge for agricultural purposes on the premises. This matter will be resolved within seven days. This plant is not contributing to the situation highlighted above, other than its design to channel effluent into the municipal sewer referred to above, the NDPW said. The Department has written to Joburg Water and the City of Joburg to treat the matter with the urgency it deserves. African News Agency
