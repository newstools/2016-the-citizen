An armed robbery suspect wanted in KwaMashu, KwaZulu-Natal, has been arrested in Hillbrow, Johannesburg, police said on Thursday. Captain Nqobile Gwala said police from King Cetshwayo Cluster Crime Intelligence, with the help of the National Intervention Unit acting on a tip-off traced the suspect and arrested him in the Hillbrow area. The members proceeded to Hillbrow, where they traced and arrested the suspect, said Gwala. It is alleged that on November 30, 2013, at about 2.30pm, a 38-year-old man was walking along Jabula Road, near KwaMashu hostel, when he was approached by two men. He was allegedly threatened with a firearm, and the suspects took his cash before they fled the scene. A case of armed robbery was opened at KwaMashu Police Station for further investigation, said Gwala. He said the arrested suspect might be linked to other crimes reported in KwaMashu. He will face a charge of armed robbery when he appears in the Ntuzuma Magistrates Court.
