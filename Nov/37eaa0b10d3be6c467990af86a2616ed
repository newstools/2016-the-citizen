Judging by what Bonang &#8216;Queen B&#8217; Matheba has been sharing on Twitter, 2017 is only going to get better for her. Bonang took to Twitter on Thursday night to announce that her book would be available nationwide in April next year, news that gave her fans something to look forward to. Without giving away more details about the book, fans are already saying Matheba will be talking about her drama with DJ Zinhle, Pearl Thusi and past relationship with DJ Euphonik. Hopefully, she won&#8217;t dish out dirt on him, as he has also said he had dirt on her. Very excited&#8230;.
