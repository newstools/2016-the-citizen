It is hard to imagine that the motion of no confidence against President Jacob Zuma being proposed in parliament today has a chance of succeeding. ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe was almost dismissive of the DA s list of reasons for the proposal, calling it a frivolous ritual . In this, he is almost certainly right. Riven though it might be with internal dissention, the ANC tends to rally and pull together en masse on issues as important as this one. Zuma has also survived a motion for his impeachment over the Nkandla homestead scandal. But the very fact that this is the fifth such motion put forward against the same individual since 2012 must surely be an indictment. The DA maintains it has tabled the motion for wreaking havoc in the infant democracy, 783 corruption charges, Nkandla, the Omar al-Bashir saga, the Guptas and the State of Capture . DA leader Mmusi Maimane is surely aware Mantashe has probably cut to the heart of the slim chances of any success on the current motion, but labelling it frivolous cheapens the business of opposition parties to raise their disapproval of the ruling party and to enter this in parliamentary debate.
