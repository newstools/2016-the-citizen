What we already know is that power couple Kiernan &#8216;AKA&#8217; Forbes and Bonang &#8216;Queen B&#8217; Matheba are loaded, but exactly how much is their net worth? Bonang, perhaps the highest paid host in South Africa, bought her first house in her early 20s. It only got better from there, as she went on to buy a bigger house, being featured on the show she presents, Top Billing. She is a Revlon ambassador and was in the past few weeks named Brazilian footwear Ipanema&#8217;s Africa ambassador. She also hosts The Front Row, which features Ask A Man, perhaps the only daily segment that trends on a daily basis. She is also vodka brand Ciroc&#8217;s ambassador. Bonang has also been a Woolworths lingerie ambassador, with her range, Distraction for Bonang, proving to be successful, as it has been going on for years now. We would never be able to count the number of presenting gigs the Queen B has bagged this year alone, with the most recent being the Afrimas in Nigeria, though the most-talked about was the MTV Africa Music Awards after she was announced as Comedian Trevor Noah&#8217;s replacement. She reportedly bagged R500 000 from the gig. It does not come as a surprise that she owns a Mercedes-AMG CLA45 and an SUV G63.

With all the money rolling in for the couple, Drum Magazine has reported that the couple were valued at R13.8 million combined. Last year, the Queen B&#8217;s net worth was estimated at R7.2 million, while AKA&#8217;s was about R6.6 million. But that&#8217;s only for 2015 who knows how much money the couple have made this year. &nbsp;
