Authorities in Mexico found nine bodies &#8212; five of which were dismembered &#8212; on a road in violence-plagued Guerrero, officials said Monday, after two sailors were found dead elsewhere in the state over the weekend. The bodies of nine males with visible signs of torture were discovered on Sunday night on a road leading between the towns of Tixtla and Atliaca, in Guerrero s central region, the state s secretary of security said in a statement. Agents at the local prosecutors office reported finding four bodies tied at the feet and hands, and noted that authorities also recovered five black plastic bags containing the remains of five more people. Those five bodies had been dismembered, with some of the body parts found outside the bags, a Tixtla police commander told AFP, requesting anonymity for security purposes. Authorities are taking steps to identify the individuals. Meanwhile, at least 10 people died in Guerrero s Pacific resort of Acapulco during a weekend of bloodshed, including two members of the Navy, said Roberto Alvarez Heredia, spokesperson for Guerrero state s security coordination group. The southern state has suffered years of drug cartel violence as gangs grow marijuana and opium poppies in remote mountains and battle for control of heroin trafficking routes. Acapulco, once a glamorous getaway for Hollywood celebrities, is now considered Mexico s murder capital, with 111 homicides per every 100 000 residents last year. In September, a top Guerrero police official and his female companion were stabbed to death in Acapulco.
