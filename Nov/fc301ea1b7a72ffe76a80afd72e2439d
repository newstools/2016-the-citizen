South African Broadcasting Corporation&#8217;s (SABC) group executive for corporate affairs Hlaudi Motsoeneng has called out Muvhango and 7de Laan producers for &#8220;robbing&#8221; actors and production staff of annual increases for almost three years. Motsoeneng held a meeting with actors two weeks ago after learning that they were given 2% wage increases instead of 6%, as they had agreed with the public broadcaster to pay actors increases related to the inflation rate, reports Sunday World. Motsoeneng reportedly gave Word of Mouth Production an ultimatum to resolve the issue before the end of November or the public broadcaster would reconsider its contract with the production house. The same warning was reportedly given to 7de Laan producers after the former SABC COO found out they were also guilty of the same practice. Speaking to the publication, SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago confirmed Motsoeneng&#8217;s meeting with the production houses but denied that the parties were fighting. He said Motsoeneng only emphasised that the production houses should increase the actors&#8217; salary as per agreement they had with the broadcaster. &nbsp; &nbsp;
