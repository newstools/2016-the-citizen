Student activist Mcebo Dlamini got a bit of a hero&#8217;s welcome after he was released on a R2 000 bail on Wednesday. Addressing a group of students, Dlamini wished matriculants well in their final examinations. He sent his good wishes &#8220;mostly to the black matriculants&#8221; from poorer government schools, who he said had received &#8220;no good education&#8221; compared to those students from former Model C schools. &#8220;I am not racist. But I choose to speak to a black child &#8230; because I understand the pain of being black better than the white pain, if there is white pain. &#8220;I would like to wish our matriculants &#8230; those that are coming from the township and those that are coming from the rural areas like Tzaneen, Lebowakgomo, Venda, Lusikisiki, Cofimvaba &#8230; those who study using paraffin, those who study using a candle. We wish them well &#8230; those who never got quality teachers, but they will be competing with St Mary&#8217;s. They will be competing with St John&#8217;s. They will be competing with all these model C schools. &#8220;I don&#8217;t blame them when they use other means to pass mathematics. We wish those matriculants well.&#8221; #MceboDlamini wishing black matriculants well with their exams. #Wits pic.twitter.com/qsZzYKYdDn &mdash; Lindokuhle Xulu (@LindokuhlXulu1) November 9, 2016 The student firebrand, who spent about three weeks in jail, was granted R2 000 bail by the South Gauteng High Court sitting in Palm Ridge. In his ruling, Judge Ratha Mokgoatlheng ordered Dlamini to desist from engaging in unlawful activities that would seek to disturb academic activities at Wits University, where he is a postgraduate law student. His high-powered legal team, comprising Advocates Dali Mpofu and Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, on Tuesday argued the charges against Dlamini did not have any substance and that they were politically motivated. The court agreed with Dlamini&#8217;s lawyers that it had been wrong to deny him bail. Dlamini is among many student protesters who were arrested at various universities throughout the country. State has failed young people The student leader also lambasted the state, saying it had failed young people. If there was free education there would be no young people in Sun City [ Johannesburg Prison]. Our people are forced to do crimes to put food on the table because of a failed state, Dlamini said while addressing students and workers outside the court gates. Dlamini, 30, faces charges of public violence, theft, malicious damage to property and assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm following his arrest at his Wits residence in October. Dlamini said police and prison warders needed free education as well in order for them to do their jobs correctly. The police need free education to avoid unlawful arrests; they can t write dockets, Dlamini said. Following court proceedings, Dlamini was welcomed by about 60 students and workers who were singing struggle songs while he walked out flanked by other student leaders. Dlamini said Wits could not expect students to write exams when they were not psychologically ready following protests. We are making a call, I know he [Wits vice-hancellor Adam Habib] is listening because he knows I m outside. By end of the day, there must be a second sitting for exams or poppe sal dans [Afrikaans expression meaning &#8216;all hell will break loose&#8217;], Dlamini said. Dlamini then instructed students to leave the court to prepare for a meeting on a way forward. He is expected back in court on November 15. &#8211; Additional reporting by African News Agency
