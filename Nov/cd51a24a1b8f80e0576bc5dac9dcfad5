Kickoff: 7.30pm (SA TIME) Tweets about #WALvSA from:Jacobs_Rudolph Inconsistent team selection cost the Boks dearly with prop Beast Mtawarira and hooker and captain Adriaan Strauss the only players to have featured in all 12 Tests. Strauss will play his 66th and final Test in a career that has spanned eight years since 2008 and he would be desperate to fire the team on to just their fifth win in their 12th Test. The Boks have played the Welsh 31 times with the Boks winning 28, Wales just two and one game ending in a draw. Wales only two wins came in 1999 when they won 29-19 and again 15 years later in 2014 when they won 12-6. Bok coach Allister Coetzee has handed debuts to centre Rohan Janse van Rensburg, wing Jamba Ulengo and flank Uzair Cassiem, while loose forward Jean-Luc du Preez could also earn his first cap should he come off the bench. Should the Boks lose today it will be their eighth loss of the season, the most SA has suffered in their history in one season, with this season s seven defeats already on par with the seven losses of 2006 under former coach Jake White. The bookmakers have predicted a Wales win of between 5-10 points. Referee: Romain Poite (France) TEAMS Wales: 15 Leigh Halfpenny, 14 George North, 13.
