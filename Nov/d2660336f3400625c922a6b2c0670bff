Parliament s standing committee on public accounts has put its foot and said it will not tolerate financial misconduct. Yesterday [Wednesday] Scopa sent four cases of financial misconduct from the State Information Technology Agency (Sita), the department of basic education, and the department of international relations to the Hawks to decide if there was indeed any criminality. The four cases included two cases that were presented by Sita, which said it had already agreed that the Hawks or other law enforcement agencies had to get involved. Scopa has also referred a case from the department of basic education where there was fruitless and wasteful expenditure of R44m from a programme called Kha ri Gude (Tshivenda for let us learn ). The department said it would be happy if the Hawks could assist with the investigation. In the fourth case, the committee agreed the Hawks should investigate allegations against the chief financial officer within the department of foreign affairs and cooperation. Chairperson Themba Godi said after the Hawks had investigated the cases they would have to report back to Scopa. This was to determine whether the Hawks would garner support from the National Prosecuting Authority to investigate and potentially prosecute.
