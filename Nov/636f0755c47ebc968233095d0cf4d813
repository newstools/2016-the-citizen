Dar es Salaam. Tanzania football sensation, Mbwana Samatta, is likely going through a mental turmoil following a lengthy goal drought.Samatta, who is the Taifa Stars captain, extended his search for the first goal in nearly three months as Taifa Stars were bashed 3-0 by Zimbabwe in a friendly match played in Harare on Sunday.The KRC Genk forward was almost anonymous in the Sunday s game, prompting questions over his mental state following a long goalless spell.He, however, cannot shoulder the blame for the Stars defeat as the entire team could not play as a unit. They hardly trained together for a day. But, Samatta, arguably the most admired footballer in the country at the moment, looks to have moved into a downward spiral.The 23-year-old has now gone 17 matches with just a goal under his belt in all competitions.According to statistics, the former Simba SC hot shot has played about 850 minutes with his last goal coming in mid-August.It is the longest spell without a goal in his playing career and this has kept fans doubting about his progress at the Belgian outfit, which features in the topflight league.In his first season with Genk, the 1.8-metre tall striker played 16 matches (877 minutes) and scored five goals. He grabbed the limelight as his scoring rate stood at 175.4 minutes per goal.Samatta, who enjoyed more starting role in his first season, has found himself relegated to the substitutes bench by manager Peter Maes.This has fans concerned over his ambitions of moving to English or Spanish clubs. The last time the former TP Mazembe man scored for the national team was in March, against Chad when Stars claimed a 1-0 win in N Djamena.The victory was, however, annulled after Chad decided to withdraw from the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations.Nonetheless, the goal drought does not trouble the Tanzania s prodigious striker. He looks forward to re-discovering his scoring touch with KRC Genk sooner rather than later.
