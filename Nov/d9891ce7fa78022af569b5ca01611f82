It is cause for some concern that Shadrack Sibiya, former head of the Hawks in Gauteng, has been appointed to head Johannesburg s metropolitan anti-corruption unit. It must be stressed that while Sibiya has not been found guilty of an offence, he nevertheless faces criminal charges and left the Hawks under a cloud last year following the scandal surrounding a 2010 crime intelligence operation dubbed the Zimbabwean rendition case, which led to former Hawks boss Lieutenant-General Anwa Dramat, police captain Lesley Maluleke and Sibiya being charged earlier this year with kidnapping, defeating the ends of justice and illegal deportation. Whether these charges, as has been widely alleged, were justified or the result of internal divisions within the ranks of the Hawks, has still to be fully tested by the justice system despite the North Gauteng High Court ruling in favour of Sibiya when he was suspended. It is not for us to attempt to unravel the Machiavellian internal mechanics of the Hawks, and Sibiya has been recognised as an extremely competent law enforcement officer. It must also be made clear that the concern is not directed at the man himself, but rather at any possible tainting of the important office he has been tasked to fill.
