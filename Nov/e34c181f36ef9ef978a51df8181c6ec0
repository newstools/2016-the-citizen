Afrikaner singer and activist Steve Hofmeyr, along with about 500 other Afrikaners, gathered on Saturday at Church Square in Pretoria to declare that their &#8220;volk&#8221; (nation) needs to stand up to establish unity among Afrikaners. He said that the so-called &#8220;deadweight&#8221; of transformation, reconciliation and white guilt needed to be dropped. He said the Afrikaner nation needed the opportunity to rule over its own special interests. He even claimed that the purpose of apartheid had never been to oppress anyone.
