Arusha. The Arusha Regional Athletics Association (ARAA) is opposed to the planned elections by Athletics Tanzania (AT), citing some irregularities.The association s chairman Jackson Jolwa said they will not keep quiet while on the general election if it will be conducted in a manner that contravenes the constitution of the national body as well as that of the National Sports Council (NSC).He said the current AT officials were illegally holding the positions because they should have stepped down on May 31.He added that the elections should have been organised prior to expiry of their tenure.The regional athletics boss said AT planned to hold the elections using the so-called new Constitution whose draft, he explained, was rejected during the last polls held in Morogoro on May 2012.He observed during an interview with The Citizen that the draft Constitution was unacceptable and should not be used as a guideline for the proposed elections unless it is endorsed by the national meeting of athletic associations throughout the country.He further added he had been told the names of the contestants for AT top posts would be announced publicly on November 26, only a day before the planned elections. We will do all we can to file an injunction against it, he said, wondering how the AT lawyer Thabit Bashir has failed to address the issue from the legal point of view.When contacted over the issue, the NSC secretary general Mohamed Kiganja faulted ARAA officials for constant complaints through the media houses, saying they should sort out their grievances with the RT national leaders.
