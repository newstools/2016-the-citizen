Ertugral took everyone by surprise when he announced his resignation live on TV following Pirates 6-1 loss to SuperSport. His departure was later confirmed by club chairperson Irving Khoza at a press conference at Rand Stadium last Thursday. They re a great club, and I wish them well. There are no bad feelings. As a coach, you always know you re the driver and realise that it s not working out. My track record in South Africa speaks for itself, Ertugral told SunSport. Ertugral said he was leaving for Istanbul this week where he will be doing TV work for local Turkish stations. I have TV appearances lined up and have a business that needs to be attended to. I ll also be visiting my family in Turkey. I want to take a break now. I m sorry things didn t work out with Pirates. I have had feelers from clubs in Turkey, but I ll take a rest and enjoy time with my family. Ertugral thanked Khoza for giving him a chance to lead the Buccaneers. He s done wonders for the PSL and local soccer. I ve great respect for him.
