Mwanza. Health authorities have warned residents of the possible spread of cholera in the region.The warning has been issued following reports that some neighbouring regions have reported cholera outbreaks.Given the contagious nature of the disease, health officials believe if people are not careful, it is just a matter to time before it spreads to the region.Speaking to The Citizen yesterday, Mwanza regional health officer Sophia Kiluvia said they had launched a campaign to create public awareness on the water borne disease to contain its spread. We have put up strategies to let the residents understand that there is cholera in the neighbouring regions and, therefore, a need to keep their surrounding neighbourhoods clean. The campaign is conducted through posters and voice-overs, she said.She noted that Morogoro, Mara and Kigoma regions had reported cholera outbreaks and that had forced them to launch the campaign to create public awareness.Ms Sophia added that the disease was very contagious and thus urged people to be careful particularly during this rainy season. The risk of contracting the disease is mainly by poor water and environmental sanitation, including open defecation. Mwanza residents should wash their hands with soap frequently and thoroughly, especially after coming from a toilet. Develop a culture of boiling water before drinking if you are not sure of its source, Ms Kiluvia advisedThe health officer also called on the residents to stop open defecation, which could lead to a cholera outbreak.Cholera symptoms include nausea, profuse diarrhoea, vomiting, fever and leg cramps. In severe cases, cholera can lead to dehydration, coma or death.Cholera is an acute diarrhoea disease with or without vomiting caused by a bacteria known as Vibro cholerae and it is transmitted through ingestion of food or water contaminated with infective faeces.Food or water contamination is usually due to poor sanitation and the source of contamination is usually other cholera cases, when their infective watery stool gets into food or drinking water supplies.Prevention of cholera can be achieved through basic water sanitation, such as boiling water from unclean sources. Cholera can kill within hours if left untreated.
