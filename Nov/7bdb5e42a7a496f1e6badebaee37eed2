Olympic gold medallist Caster Semenya is tired of her haters. She won Sportswoman of the Year award at the South African Sports Award on Sunday night and gave a speech that left the audience in stitches. She said: &#8220;They say she talks like a man, she walks like a man, she runs like a man uh tsek! Okay.&#8221; Watch the video below: http://twitter.com/Luwiman/status/802964762812358656?lang=en Most of her fans commended her for her &#8220;bravery&#8221; and understood the insult was directed at her haters. &#8220;Don&#8217;t understand, as I&#8217;m Scottish, but I hope it means &#8216;F**k You!&#8217; She endures such abuse from all quarters and still performs for SA,&#8221; said one follower. So if you&#8217;re a Caster hater now, you know how she feels about you.
