Dar es Salaam. Taifa Stars head coach Charles Mkwasa has apportioned blame on the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) following a 3-0 bashing by Zimbabwe on Sunday.Mkwasa said the national team suffered a humiliation in Harare because players had no enough time to train together.The former Stars defender said the TFF ought to reschedule some Vodacom Premier League matches to enable players to link up at the national team camp early. He said there was no need for the TFF to insist on the completion of league matches while denying Stars a chance to train for the friendly match. People are blaming Stars players for a disorganized performance against Zimbabwe, but they forget that these players did not have enough time to train together before the match, said Mkwasa. I don t see why the last Premier League matches weren t rescheduled. I announced the team early enough and the authorities should have given this match the consideration it deserves. However, they did not want to alter the fixtures and that rendered it impossible for the team to train aptly. Change is imperative otherwise we will always be blaming the wrong people. He added: Let s take a leaf from neighbours like Malawi. They halted the league and gave the national team two weeks of training. Foreign players need four days to gel, according Fifa rules, but Taifa Stars has only three of them, so this group should have had enough training sessions. Stars had a one-day serious training session before flying to the Zimbabwean capital where they displayed a lethargic performance. Yes, the league is important, but you can t prefer league matches and ignore the national team. The TFF has to reconsider this, raged the tactician. Stars, ranked at 144th place, will most likely suffer a drop in the next Fifa world rankings, which would be released next Thursday.
