The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) has accused Floxy Four, a small mining company in the North West, of mining at night using illegal immigrants, saying on Friday it was extremely shocked and disturbed by this. Floxy Four is based in Amalia township in the North West province. The company got its mining licence in 2012. In a statement, NUM deputy president Joseph Montisetse said the mine had not been officially operational since 2012, but there were trucks operating every night which showed that the mine was operating at night. The community has also reported that there are illegal immigrants who are used as cheap labourers at night and the NUM has reported the matter to the Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) three times, Montisetse said.

Montisetse also said the NUM was worried because the laws of this country were not respected. He said former mineworkers who used to work for Floxy Four now lived in abject poverty as the mine was the only source of employment for the community of Amalia township. We are also disturbed that DMR as the regulator is fully aware of this illegal mining but they are doing nothing, Montisetse said. DMR spokesperson Martin Madlala said he would respond once the department s regional office, to which he referred the matter, has replied. Floxy Four mine representatives could not be reached for comment. African News Agency
