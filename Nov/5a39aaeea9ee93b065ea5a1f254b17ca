As the African National Congress (ANC) national executive committee (NEC) meeting is ongoing, there have been questions as to who might be a capable candidate should they decide to remove President Jacob Zuma from his position.

Taking to Twitter on Monday, Mazwai was engaging with her followers on who they think should take South Africa forward.

In fact, she said she would be &#8220;cool&#8221; with United Democratic Movement (UDM) leader Bantu Holomisa being president. One of her followers suggested former Reserve Bank governor Tito Mboweni. However, Mazwai did not think he was a good candidate either. Artist and activist Ntsiki Mazwai.
