Initially, the G-class was developed as a military vehicle from a suggestion by the Shah of Iran to Mercedes, and it was then offered as a civilian version in 1979. With almost 37-years since we had taste of this &#8216;bossy&#8217; SUV, Mercedes-AMG seems to be hard at work readying its current G63 s replacement, which will likely debut before the end of the decade. , The spied G63 seems to boast wider fenders to make room for the chunkier wheels, while at the front it has larger air vents to improve engine cooling. Thankfully, Mercedes is keeping the new G-Wagen (W464) just as boxy as the original 1979 model, and in the AMG specification, it s going to look more aggressive to match the extra grunt coming from underneath the hood. Power is expected to be provided by the now familiar biturbo 4.0-litre V8 available in a wide array of models and in multiple outputs. In its strongest iteration, the E63 S, the eight-cylinder motor unleashes 450kW and 850Nm, but it s too soon to say whether the G63 will receive the full power. Even if it won t, it will still be stronger than the outgoing 420kW model. Rumours suggest the new G63 will be lighter than the outgoing model, with about 408kg to be shed. . Performance figures remain coy at this moment, but with so much weight-shedding rumours, it means the new G63 will be way faster than the current model. The regular next-gen G-Class is expected to be unveiled sometime next year, with the Frankfurt Motor Show set for September likely to be the venue of choice. As for the G63, it will likely arrive before the end of the decade and should be followed shortly by its V12-powered G65 counterpart.
