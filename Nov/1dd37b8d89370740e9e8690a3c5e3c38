Former public protector Thuli Madonsela has hit back at President Jacob Zuma, as the public spat over her State of Capture report between the two figures persists. Madonsela at the weekend told The Citizen Zuma had no right or power to determine who can or cannot speak on a report issued by the public protector . Her utterances followed a Friday statement by the presidency suggesting she back off, as her unwarranted attacks on Zuma were &#8220;unbecoming&#8221;.

The presidency had lodged a complaint with the office of the public protector after eNCA published the interview on its website last week. In the audio, Madonsela could be heard telling Zuma he had already been given seven months notice to respond to her questions. We asked you, sir, in March to respond to the issues that are being raised, Madonsela said. There were seven months for us to receive a version from the president. Madonsela said she released the audio to get the public to discern the truth for itself. I did step back after the new public protector issued a statement to the effect that she prefers to answer all questions on the [State of Capture] report, she said. After noting a lot of attacks on me without any response from the public protector, I considered it prudent to clarify what only I could clarify. Madonsela said she also clarified the prohibition regarding disclosing information or evidence only applied during the investigation and only to people other than the public protector. Madonsela then apologised if anything I said was perceived as an attack on the president . Zuma s spokesperson, Bongani Ngqulunga, could not be reached for comment. ngwakom@citizen.co.za
