National Treasury plans to review a contract entered into by South African Airways but is still awaiting documentation and approval from the leadership of the troubled national carrier, according to a parliamentary response from Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan published on Wednesday. Gordhan did not disclose the contract in question, unlike in the instance of those signed by other state-owned entities that are being reviewed by National Treasury. The question, submitted by the Democratic Alliance, asked whether each state-owned company in question was cooperating with the investigation.

The response confirmed the known review of Eskom s coal contracts, which includes the utility s controversial deals with the Gupta family s Tegeta as well as Transnet s contract with Trillian. However, the planned review of an SAA deal was not known and was not listed in a briefing by Chief Procurement Officer Kenneth Brown to MPs in May this year when the mulling of other contracts entered into by parastatals to a value exceeding R10 million was noted. National Treasury spokeswoman Yolisa Tyantsi suggested that Gordhan s response omitted details of the contract because the matter remained subject to discussion with SAA s leadership.
