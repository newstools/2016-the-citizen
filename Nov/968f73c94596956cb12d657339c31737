The Johannesburg Zoo on Thursday said it would remain open after a boundary wall on Jan Smuts Avenue collapsed following flash floods in the Parkview area. On Wednesday, heavy rains resulted in flash floods that wreaked havoc in various parts of Johannesburg and Ekurhuleni. Johannesburg Zoo acting head Oscar Van Heerden said through personal assistant Jane Dube that the animals were secure because they could not gain access to the road, as there was another fence. No animals escaped as there is another fence blocking their path, Dube said, adding the zoo would rebuild the boundary wall. The Johannesburg Zoo said in a tweet that it would open at 10am on Thursday. The zoo thanks you for the concern for the animals. We want to assure you that all is fine, our vets are attending to stressed animals, the management said on Twitter.
