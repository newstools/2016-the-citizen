Eskom on Thursday urged South Africans to practise extreme caution during heavy rains and to avoid any contact with exposed electric wires and cables. Jace Naidoo, the corporate occupational health and safety senior manager at Eskom, said in heavy winds or storms, electricity poles could fall over. Fallen poles may result in live electrical wires lying on the ground or otherwise hanging low enough to endanger people. Naidoo said illegal connections were also extremely dangerous , as they were not installed according to acceptable safety standards, and the material used was often substandard. Electrical equipment exposed to water can be extremely dangerous. It s crucial that people are on the lookout for damaged and exposed cables inside and outside their homes, Naidoo said in a statement. Electricity travels through water and the threat of electrocution increases with strong winds and heavy rains, as power cables may become damaged and poles may fall over, putting the public at greater risk than normal. Naidoo urged families returning home to flood-damaged areas to stay well clear of any overhead power cables that were damaged or hanging low. Naidoo also warned against attempting to remove any fallen trees or broken branches near powerlines. Eskom or municipality authorities should be requested for assistance. Do not assume any part of your home to be safe until it is tested. Cables that are exposed to water or excessive moisture can become damaged electrical equipment in your home that has been covered in water may have to be replaced, Naidoo said.
