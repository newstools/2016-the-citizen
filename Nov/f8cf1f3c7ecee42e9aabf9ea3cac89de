Pole position draw could enable Diamond In The Sky to get the run of the race in Race 6, a FM 69 Handicap over 1400m on the Greyville Polytrack tonight. This Var filly has done well on this surface having finished runner-up behind Last Chirp in June and a close-up fourth behind Miss Brody at this track. Jockey Anton Marcus is back aboard this filly. Earlier on the card we should get very good runs out of Prince Myshkin in Race 1 and Hot Mambo in Race 2. As with most of Silvano s progeny they get better with age and Prince Myshkin could only be starting to really find his feet now. His last two runs suggest he is improving and from a good draw will be hard to beat in this Maiden Plate over 1200m. The Mark Dixon-trained Mambo In Seattle filly Hot Mambo has run behind two promising fillies when beaten by both Dame Eleanor and Accidental Tourist so looks the right one in the Maiden Plate over 1200m. Jockey Keagan de Melo knows the filly well and having her first taste of the Polytrack should not be a problem. If things have not progressed as expected it might pay to get out on Tessa Dubois in the lucky last race. Trainer Sean Tarry usually does well with his runners who try the Polytrack for the first time and the Count Dubois filly is likely to improve. Her only real danger appears to be Matresse. This Silvano filly is trained by in-form Charles Laird.
