The African National Congress believes that the State of Capture report released last week by former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela should be subjected to a judicial review before a judicial commission of inquiry is even appointed. This emerged at a press conference in Durban, where the party s provincial secretary Super Zuma was speaking on resolutions taken by the party s provincial executive committee. We are particularly concerned that the former public protector believes it was not important for her to leave all incomplete and outstanding tasks to her successor but instead chose to release a report that makes political statements as opposed to legal findings, he said.

That is wrong. That is unconstitutional. Why are we told by an outgoing public protector that the president is not capable of appointing a judge? It is illegal and unprecedented, said Ntuli. He accused Madonsela of inflating her authority . Zuma said that the PEC still supported the Chapter 9 institutions but that it felt that Madonsela s report was incomplete and exceedingly generalising on a variety of issues, including a serious allegation against the ANC President, comrade Jacob Zuma . Zuma said the PEC also welcomed the withdrawal of fraud charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. Asked for a reaction to comments made outside the Newcastle Magistrates court on Monday, where Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema said they were not calling for the slaughtering of white people, at least for now , Zuma simply said Malema needed to face the charges against him in court. &#8211; African News Agency
