An Eersterust primary school principal has been removed from the post following an ongoing probe into alleged mismanagement of funds, the Gauteng department of education said yesterday. This was after the former school governing body (SGB) picked up discrepancies in the PS Fourie Primary School s finances in 2012. The finance administrator at the time had allegedly taken the money, but paid it back before resigning from the school. The principal was under investigation because he was the accountable officer during the time of the mismanagement. Department spokesperson Oupa Bodibe condemned the incident. The principal has been temporarily removed from the school until investigations are done, Bodibe said. In 2014, the principal was suspended for three months following forensic investigations, but returned to work in May that year. Bodibe said the outcome of the investigation would determine the appropriate action to be taken by the department. To prevent financial mismanagement in public schools, Bodibe said the department was training SGB members on their roles and responsibilities regarding the management of finances. There is regular monitoring of finances of the schools and implementation of Regulations of Finances of Public Schools Act of 2014. The South African Council for Educators said it would determine if the principal was still fit to be registered with the body once the probe was completed. We give the department the first opportunity to deal with the matter, as they have to make sure their employees are not defrauding them, CEO Rej Brijraj said. PS Fourie s SGB refused to comment on the matter.
