Nico Rosberg won his maiden Formula One world title by securing second place behind his Mercedes arch-rival Lewis Hamilton in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Sunday. Rosberg started the 21st and final race of 2016 12 points clear of Hamilton and despite the British reigning champion doing everything he could, Rosberg took second to clinch his first championship by five points. He emulates his father Keke who won the title in 1982. With the race win his tenth of the year assured Hamilton ignored team orders to speed up as he toyed with the pace, slowing it down in a last ditch bid to try to allow third-placed Sebastian Vettel and fourth-placed Max Verstappen to overtake Rosberg. Rosberg returned to applause and cheers from the pits, and lifted F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone up in the air in a massive bear hug. In contrast there was barely any contact between Rosberg and him and deposed champion Hamilton before the presentation. str/nr/tw 1994-2016 Agence France-Presse
