by Andy SCOTT The world&#8217;s most expensive player headed in France&#8217;s equaliser before Dimitri Payet got the winning goal in the World Cup qualifier at the Stade de France on Friday. It was Pogba&#8217;s eighth goal for his country and followed his winner in the 1-0 victory away to the Netherlands last month. The 23-year-old also scored a superb volley in United&#8217;s 3-1 win at Swansea City in the English Premier League last weekend but Deschamps said: &#8220;He is not a goal-scorer. He can score goals and has done so but I don&#8217;t especially expect him to do that. &#8220;All the better that he did so today but I am much more happy with his overall performance which followed on from what he did in the Netherlands. &#8220;For Manchester he is used in a different position in a different system. He gave us a lot of fluidity with the ball and was good at winning possession back,&#8221; Deschamps added. &#8220;When Paul is playing like that and has a good partnership with Blaise Matuidi it is important for the team. If he scores, all the better. I know he likes scoring but it is not what I or the team expect from him.&#8221; France are three points clear of Sweden at the top of Group A four games into European qualifying for the 2018 World Cup thanks to Payet&#8217;s 65th-minute winner. There was a touch of controversy about the goal, however, as Antoine Griezmann was in an offside position in the build-up. The striker&#8217;s presence then led to goalkeeper Robin Olsen fumbling a cross, allowing Payet to score. &#8220;Sweden deserved a better result. It is a bit of a shame because the second goal was offside, but these things happen in sport,&#8221; lamented visiting coach Janne Andersson, whose team had gone in front through a superb Emil Forsberg free-kick at the start of the second half. Deschamps responded: &#8220;I saw that he was slightly offside. His tibia was offside. It wasn&#8217;t given, and all the better for us. &#8220;But there was also a cross and an error that led to the goal. It could have been given. There wasn&#8217;t much in it and it went in our favour. I understand the anger and disappointment of my Swedish colleague.&#8221; The game was played almost exactly a year on from the terror attacks that struck Paris on Friday November 13, 2015. A total of 130 people were killed in the attacks, including one man when three suicide bombers blew themselves up outside the Stade de France while France were playing Germany in a friendly. A minute&#8217;s silence was held for the victims to mark the anniversary before the Sweden game, while France&#8217;s president Francois Hollande was in attendance. &#8220;Time goes on but nobody will forget, or can forget, what happened,&#8221; said Deschamps. &#8220;We need to go on but it is important to show our solidarity to the victims, their families and everyone who was so deeply affected a year ago now.&#8221;
