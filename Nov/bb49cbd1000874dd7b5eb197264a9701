MTN South Africa said on Wednesday it had appointed Giovanni Chiarelli as chief technology and information officer. The Milan-educated Chiarelli has more than 17 years of experience in the field working for companies such as Infostrada, Accenture, Telecom Italia and Vodafone Group, including as chief technology officer of Vodafone Romania. He takes over from Babak Fouladi, who was the interim CTO in addition to his role as MTN group executive for technology and information systems. Chiarelli is expected to build on the network improvement milestones that have been achieved in the last 18 months and will be tasked with shaping and driving technology and information strategies for MTN SA, the company said in a statement. MTN SA chief Mteto Nyati thanked Fouladi for exceptional work in the interim role. He added: In just over six months, we witnessed MTN SA emerge as a customer-centric and quality orientated organisation. Early results have indicated that the network improvement plans are bearing fruit, which creates much needed momentum going into the festive season and 2017. I remain confident that the wealth of international experience that Chiarelli brings will enable our continued quest of building higher performing networks; transforming customer experience and leading the delivery of a bold, new digital world.
