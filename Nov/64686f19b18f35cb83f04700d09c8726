Dar es Salaam. Producers and service providers must aspire for provision of quality products/services if they are to compete in the local and international markets amid a growing zeal to industrialise Tanzania, experts said at the weekend.The chairman for Amen Consulting Ltd, Dr Benjamin Sirimba - whose company provides guidance and training to private companies and public institutions in the country to be able to obtain the International Standards (ISO) certification said at the weekend that the passion to industrialise Tanzania must go together with the focus on an export-oriented production, hence the need for quality certification. Industrialisation must go along with an increase in business competition, so for a company/institution to survive in such a situation, it has to look for markets outside the country and that is where the importance of ISO 9001:2008 certification comes in, Dr Sirimba said during a brief ceremony to present the aforementioned certificate to the Dar Salaam-based transportation company, ZH Poppe Ltd.He said ZH Poppe Ltd was able to meet the requirements of ISO certification after it underwent rigorous six-month training and an in-depth review of internal processes during the implementation phase.The training, he said, involved cultural changes needed to become an ISO 9001;2008 certified organization.Working closely with Consumer Pride Africa, Amen Consulting Ltd improves technical capacity that has a wide experience of certification with government ministries and parastatals. It aims at enhancing guidance and training to private companies and public institutions in the country so they can be able to attain various ISO certifications.Speaking after receiving the certificate, the managing director for ZH Poppe Ltd, Mr Zacharia Poppe said achieving the ISO 9001:2008 certification guarantees his company s clients that they can be assured of receiving high-quality services from the Dar es Salaam-based firm. All the employees from different departments including our drivers went through this vigorous process. We therefore expect a change in their driving culture which we hope will lead to a reduction in road accidents, said Mr Poppe.
