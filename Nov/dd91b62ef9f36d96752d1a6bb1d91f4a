The police minister has been ordered to pay over R2.2 million in compensation to a Middelburg couple who fell victim to an escaped prisoner and his cohort on their farm seven years ago. In terms of a settlement confirmed by the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria, the minister agreed to compensate the couple who cannot be named for the ordeal they suffered when a notorious criminal, Mduduzi Nkosi, and an accomplice attacked them on their farm days after escaping from the cells at the Middelburg Magistrates Court. The man was repeatedly hit over the head with a hammer while he was digging a trench outside their house to divert water away during a storm. He lost consciousness, had a seizure and was close to death when neighbours brought him to hospital in the early hours of the morning. He sustained a brain injury and one of his fingers later had to be amputated. The woman was tied up, forced into a bakkie and taken to an open area where both men took turns to rape her. She was later pushed out of the bakkie and had to walk about 7km naked to the nearest house for help. The woman had the presence of mind to pick up her underwear on noticing that one of her rapists had wiped himself with it. The DNA was later used in the criminal trial. Nkosi and Johannes Mthimunye were sentenced to life imprisonment in separate trials on charges of rape, robbery, attempted murder and kidnapping. The couple were so traumatised that both now suffer from post traumatic stress disorder and major depression. The man developed a paranoid disorder while the woman suffered from anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder and had a social phobia. They claimed in court papers Nkosi had escaped because of the police s negligence, who left a cell door unlocked, did not react while Nkosi was sawing through bars and left the exit unguarded during a lunch break. The minister conceded liability for the couple s damages.
