The University of Pretoria s Tuks Camerata student choir will be launching a new CD, Love and War, on Monday in celebration of their selection to perform at the prestigious World Symposium on Choral Music in Barcelona next year. The Tuks Camerata is currently ranked fifth worldwide by Interkultur. The choir represents the best in South African diversity, with the 80 members spanning all of South Africa s race and cultural groups. While they already have a string of accolades, being selected to perform at the World Symposium is especially noteworthy, as only 24 choirs are selected. Tuks Camerata is the only choir representing the African continent.
