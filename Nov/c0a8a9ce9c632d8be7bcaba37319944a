Commander in Chief of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Julius Malema has left some of his followers wondering if his Twitter account has been hacked. This after he posted a picture of his &#8220;friend&#8221; and model Babalwa Mneno with the caption: &#8220;She&#8217;s my friend and it&#8217;s her baeday today, happy earthday my babe girl. I will always be indebted to u 4 ur loyalty [sic].&#8221; However, it was not the birthday message that raised eyebrows. The picture of Babalwa Mneno shared was rather sexy, with the model in a white shirt, and what looks like underwear, if not very short shorts. It seems the model was in a club and smoking a cigar. We must say, Mneno still has it even after all her years out of the spotlight. Even the EFF&#8217;s Mandisa thinks so too. &#8220;Babalwa Mneno has always been one of the sexiest ladies in SA. Jealous down! Happy Birthday to her; she exudes girl-power,&#8221; she commented on Malema&#8217;s post. Perhaps she was also trying to set the record straight for those who were not sure who the girl in the picture was. She&#39;s my friend and it&#39;s her baeday today, happy earthday my babe girl. I will always be indebted to u 4 ur loyalty. pic.twitter.com/KkXbvVaROb &mdash; Julius Sello Malema (@Julius_S_Malema) November 12, 2016 However, most of his followers were not impressed with the &#8220;inappropriate&#8221; picture. &#8220;You should have choosen a better picture than this one, what messages are you sending to young people as a leader[sic],&#8221; one follower asked. &#8220;Last time u criticized the ANC for parading the druggiest now you posting this 1 in public. Show true Ledership Sir [sic],&#8221; said another. Another thought it was unfair that Malema only sent his well wishes to Mneno, and not many other loyal EFF supporters. &#8220;CIC we are the friends of the EFF and loyal as well but never get birthday wishes&#8230;kanjani???&#8221; One only said Malema was a lucky man to have a wife who understands &#8220;when u have friends like this&#8221;. Share your thoughts. Do you think the picture is inappropriate, or are people blowing this out of proportion?
