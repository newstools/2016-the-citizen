Monday s meeting between the ANC s national working committee and party stalwarts was a step closer to the phasing out of President Jacob Zuma, political analyst Andre Duvenhage says. He said recent comments by Zuma in KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga meant the battle lines had been drawn. The difference is that Zuma still has just over 50% of the support, while Thabo Mbeki lost control during his tenure, Duvenhage said. Hence the ANC is aware of the risks associated with pressuring Zuma out of office because there are still those also who have vowed to fight for him.

Zuma is expected to answer questions on Wednesday during the last sitting of parliament for the year. Duvenhage said opposition parties could be expected to continue putting pressure on the president. But I do not expect a rebellion in the context of the ANC, rather the possibility of some ANC MPs choosing not to attend the last parliament sitting. This cannot be ruled out. Duvenhage said Zuma would not easily step down.
