Dar es Salaam. Tanzanians may soon be required to dig deeper into their pockets in financing their energy bills as Tanzania Electric Supply Company (Tanesco) seeks to increase power tariffs by 18.19 per cent.In view of the tariff increase proposal, the Energy and Water Utilities Regulatory Authority (EWURA) is expected to hold a public inquiry meeting to seek views of the public on the application.A statement, issued by Ewura in Dar es Salaam noted yesterday that the tariff review application is made pursuant to Tanesco Tariff Adjustment Order 2016 that came into effect on April 1, this year that required the utility firm to resubmit its application for the year 2017.
