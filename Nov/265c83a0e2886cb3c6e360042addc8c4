Dewani was accused of hiring three men, who are serving time in jail, to murder his wife. The prosecution alleged that Dewani wanted to get out of the marriage because he was attracted to men as well. After a lengthy legal battle to extradite him from the UK, Dewani was charged in Cape Town with murder, kidnapping, robbery with aggravating circumstances, and conspiracy to commit these crimes but was acquitted after the Western Cape High Court found there was no credible evidence against him.
