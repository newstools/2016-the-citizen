Manchester United manager Mourinho spoke about Taylor ahead of last month&#8217;s goalless draw away to arch-rivals Liverpool in the Premier League. Taylor&#8217;s suitability to take charge of the game was widely questioned in the build-up, mainly on account of the fact he lives in Altrincham, near Manchester. Mourinho, asked for his view, said: &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to say anything about it, but I think Mr Taylor is a very good referee. But I think somebody with intention, is putting much pressure on him, that I feel it will be difficult for him to have a very good performance.&#8221; Though far from the most incendiary remarks the Portuguese boss has made during his time in England, they were enough to land Mourinho with a misconduct charge by the Football Association, with his comments said to have been improper and/or brought the game into disrepute. Mourinho accepted the improper conduct element but contested the disrepute charge. But an independent regulatory commission found against him and imposed a fine. Their reasons for doing so were made public on Wednesday. &#8220;Despite saying that he (Mourinho) did not want to say anything, he contradicts himself by offering actual comment on the match official,&#8221; the commission found. &#8220;This opinion, his opinion, was that he felt it would be difficult for Anthony Taylor to have a very good performance. There was no need for Mr Mourinho to be drawn into offering an opinion. &#8220;The regulatory commission considered this opinion to bring an additional layer of pressure and implication onto the referee which could have had a negative impact on the game.&#8221; Taylor was widely considered to have had a good match at Anfield and the commission said: &#8220;The referee&#8217;s performance in the game appeared to have been unaffected by this additional pressure. &#8220;Nonetheless, the regulatory commission judged Mr Mourinho&#8217;s comments to have brought the game into disrepute. &#8220;In many ways, they created a sword of Damocles situation. The referee was damned if he did and damned if he didn&#8217;t. &#8220;Despite Mr Mourinho&#8217;s assertions that the comments were not intended to be critical of Mr Taylor and were positive in nature, the regulatory commission did not share this view. &#8220;The regulatory commission were unanimous in their view that these comments had brought the game into disrepute and that the second element of the charge had been proven,&#8221; it added.
