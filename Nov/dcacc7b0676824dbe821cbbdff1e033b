The three accused in the Rhodes Park rape and murder case were on Wednesday ruffled by CCTV footage shown at the high court sitting at Palm Ridge Magistrate s Court. Thabo Nkala, 25, Admore Ndlovu, 23, and Mduduzi Mathibela Lawrence, 32, were arrested and charged with rape, murder and robbery with aggravating circumstances. The three are said to be a part of a gang which raped two women and drowned their husbands in a lake in Rhodes Park in October, 2015. Until Wednesday the accused had appeared cocky, but the CCTV footage visibly jolted them into bouts of head shaking and uncontrolled denials. Nkala vigorously shook his head in apparent denial. The incriminating footage showed a person who looked like one of the accused. The person in the video was wearing a hoodie that resembled the one worn by one of the accused.
