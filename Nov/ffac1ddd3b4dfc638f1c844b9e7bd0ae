The man who was allegedly hired by businessman Christopher Panayiotou to recruit a hitman to kidnap and kill his wife is expected to take the stand in the Port Elizabeth High Court on Friday. Christopher Panayiotou and co-accused Sinethembe Nenembe and Zolani Sibeko are on trial for the murder of Panayiotou s schoolteacher wife, Jayde Panayiotou, in April last year. Alleged triggerman Sizwezakhe Vumazonke died in custody. Self-confessed middleman Luthando Siyoni is a Section 204 witness. The State alleges Nemembe assisted Vumazonke to kidnap and murder schoolteacher Jayde Panayiotou at the behest of her husband. Vumazonke, who was the alleged link between Siyoni and the other hitman, has since died. The life skills teacher was driven to a remote area on the outskirts of Kwanobuhle, where she was murdered in April last year. The State contends Vumazonke fired two shots through Jayde s back and a final shot through her head.
