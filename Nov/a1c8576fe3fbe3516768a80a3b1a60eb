The Springboks final rugby Test of the year against Wales in Cardiff on Saturday has taken on massive significance. Not only are Allister Coetzee s men looking to avoid a record eight Test defeats in a calendar year against the Welsh Dragons today, but a loss would mean they would not finish in the world s top four ahead of next year s draw for the 2019 World Cup in Japan. Finishing outside the top four means they could be grouped together with the mighty All Blacks, Australia or England, or possibly fighting it out in a Group of Death with other top nations. But the World Cup is still three years away, and Coetzee will certainly not be looking too far ahead. His only focus should be Saturday s match against Wales, who have only recently broken their losing streak with unconvincing wins over Argentina and Japan. Coetzee s job is reportedly already on the line, and another defeat could just be the final straw for the rugby bosses back home to show him the door. Coetzee is desperate for a win. He has included three exciting rookies Rohan Janse van Rensburg, Jamba Ulengo and Uzair Cassiem in his starting XV for today s final match of their end-of-year tour. It s a move many believe should have been made against Italy last week, if not against England in their first Test of their tour after their ordinary Rugby Championship. Even if it s ugly, the Springboks need to squeeze out a victory to salvage a smidgen of pride following a disastrous 2016. In 11 Tests this year, the Boks have only managed four wins, with last week s loss to Italy in Florence their lowest moment. Losses to Ireland, Argentina, New Zealand, Australia, England and Italy does not make a pretty picture, especially if you consider they could so easily have lost all four of their victories. Rugby is rock bottom at the moment, and there can only be one way up, said Coetzee. Let s hope he is right.
