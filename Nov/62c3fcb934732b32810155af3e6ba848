We contracted EPROD Mining Services Company Ltd to remove dangerously dislodged boulders from areas affected by the earthquake .It is easy to overlook these rocks, which could anytime move in masses and cause serious risks to human life and property.So, we have assessed the area and identified some areas, which contain hazardous mass boulders, reads part of the statement.
