Former public protector Thuli Madonsela is the subject of a criminal investigation after a case was opened at the Brooklyn police station two weeks ago. The charge was laid by new public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane who acted on a complaint by president Jacob Zuma who was unimpressed when Madonsela leaked audio of an interview held during the state capture investigation to TV channel eNCA. The Sunday Times reports Madonsela did not seek permission from Mkhwebane, who had taken up the role of public protector by the time the state capture report was released. In addition, the case was opened on the basis of Madonsela allegedly contravening the Public Protector Act.

His strategy began with his support of the Gupta family in parliament when Zuma questioned the banks&#8217; action to close Oakbay accounts and when he slammed Madonsela, saying she had acted strangely and treated him unfairly in compiling her report.
