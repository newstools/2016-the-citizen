Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema has to be accountable to the law, like everyone else, says AfriForum CEO Kallie Kriel, head of the organisation that brought charges against Malema under the Prevention of Illegal Eviction from and Unlawful Occupation of Land Act after Malema urged blacks to occupy land in 2014. #FeesMustFall student activist Mcebo Dlamini had the court in uproar when he arrived wearing an ANC hat, saying he had come to support Malema. As black people, as much as we continue to say there is the EFF, there is the ANC, we will never champion the struggle of black people in South Africa (by fighting each other), Dlamini said. In a tiny, packed courtroom, chief magistrate Mziwonke Hinxa had to struggle to get to the bench past camera tripods and dozens of people crowded in to catch sight of the EFF firebrand standing in the dock.

Even with at least 20 police officers in court, at least half of whom were from the police tactical response team, the only time the hubbub and excitement subsided was when Hinxa entered the court. Hopes were high in the AfriForum camp that Malema would not be able to say the law was from the apartheid era, until National Prosecuting Authority advocate Jabulani Mlotshwa revealed Malema had been charged under the 1956 Riotous Assemblies Act, section 18 (2), which made inciting people to commit a crime illegal. Mlotshwa revealed he had already received the EFF s application to overturn the apartheid-era law and the matter would be heard in the high court. Malema s case was remanded to June 5 next year, pending the outcome of this application.
