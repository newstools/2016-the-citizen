While the State Security Minister David Mahlobo threatens to sue Al Jazeera over reports relating to his alleged link to a rhino poaching syndicate, one salient point has come slithering unwanted to the surface. While it is germane to a simmering scandal whether Mahlobo does indeed have close links to self-confessed criminal Guan Jiang Guang or not, one admission in a statement issued by the minister opens an entirely different can of worms. It is extremely reckless and mischievous for an internationally renowned broadcaster like Al Jazeera to be broadcasting such misleading content despite our response, Mahlobo said in a statement. They are basically linking the fact that I used to visit a spa in Mpumalanga solely for the services that they render, to the illegal poaching of rhino horns by its owner which I have also just been made aware of now through the aired broadcast. Guan has another, arguably less salubrious, take on the business being a spa.

I know him well a guest at my home. It could well be argued that the pressures on the minister are such that a massage provides some welcome relief from the tension. &#8220;Sushi King&#8221; Kenny Kunene and a photograph of former premier Mathews Phosa would strongly suggest that the therapists in question are indeed from Thailand. The minister must surely have been aware, whether he is a house guest of Guan or not, that the connotations of employing the services of a massage parlour could be open to some rigorous questions for a man of his stature. And it cannot have escaped Mahlobo, that should he decide to sue the television station, the massage parlour connection will feature prominently.
