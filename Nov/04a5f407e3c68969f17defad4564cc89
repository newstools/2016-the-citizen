The DA s spokesperson on finance David Maynier said the infighting within the ANC and ANC factional battles , as cited by Fitch, had the effect of distracting policymakers and leading to mixed messages, which undermined investor confidence and economic growth. Maynier said this also undermined efforts to improve governance and the streamlining of State-Owned Enterprises.
