Lucia Jakeni&#8217;s elimination from the Idols SA top five was a result of singer Kelly Khumalo&#8217;s mentoring, according to a fan who told the singer. Another one went as far as calling her a &#8220;black widow&#8221; who is a scary &#8220;witch&#8221;. Why she was being blamed for something she had nothing to do with remains a mystery. No wonder #Lucia ddnt make it @KellyNKhumalo was her mentor #IdolsSA &mdash; Emmz Morotoba (@Emmz_MO) November 6, 2016 Khumalo, who has recently released an album, My Truth, which has been receiving positive criticism from her fans so far, did not hold back from telling the follower where to get off. &#8220;Musa ukungibhedela wena [don&#8217;t be crazy] Lucia lost based on the performance she gave last week, which I had nothing to do with. Get your facts right,&#8221; she said Khumalo further said she would never waste her energy on &#8220;useless beings&#8221; who thrived on putting people down. &#8220;I&#8217;m not about that life.&#8221; Lucia&#8217;s exit from Idols SA on Sunday night left many in shock, though some said all the five contestants deserved to make it to the top four. Now in the top four is Tebogo Louw, Thami Shobede, Noma Khumalo and Terra Cox. @Emmz_MO @KellyNKhumalo Mara this black widow is a scary witch &mdash; Snenhlanhla Sibiya (@SnenhlanhlaSib5) November 7, 2016 It seems it was just not Khumalo&#8217;s day on Idols on Sunday; she was crucified for Lucia&#8217;s exit and also for calling singer Khaya Mthethwa &#8220;bae&#8221;. She posted a picture of herself with Idols SA winner Khaya Mthethwa and called him &#8220;bae&#8221;, but Mthethwa on Twitter was immediately warned against dating her. Most of the comments were tongue-in-cheek advance condolences to Mthethwa&#8217;s family, saying his &#8220;application for a death certificate was pending&#8221;. Khumalo has previously been called &#8220;babes wokufa&#8221; (babes of death), she has had two ex-boyfriends, Prosper Mkwaiwa and Senzo Meyiwa, die young. But Khumalo said she was laughing at the &#8220;stupidity&#8221; of the comments about Mthethwa dying soon because he was her &#8220;bae&#8221;. &#8220;Twitter folks are so predictable, I&#8217;m sitting laughing my lungs out on how stupid ya&#8217;ll can be,&#8221; she said, receiving yet more negative comments from fans, who said it was a pity Meyiwa was not there to share the laughter with her.
