South Africa deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas reiterated on Tuesday that government was committed to fiscal consolidation as National Treasury met with Fitch Ratings agency. We are in the process of ratings agencies reviewing South Africa s [credit] rating at the moment. Today we had a meeting with Fitch, which was focusing on what do we see as a critical way forward, Jonas told the National Assembly in the debate on the Division of Revenue Bill. It is very clear: our stance remains that fiscal consolidation and inclusive growth are going to be the two central platforms moving forward, he continued.

Standard and Poor Global Ratings has South Africa on the same grade but with a negative outlook. At its last assessment in June, Fitch had flagged low GDP growth as a concern. Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan in the medium-term budget policy statement last month, adjusted his GDP growth forecast for the year downwards to 0.5%, rising to 2% in 2018. He signalled coming tax hikes to counter the dampening effect low growth has had on government revenue. The bill was not passed on Tuesday as the National Assembly did not have a quorum. &#8211; African News Agency
