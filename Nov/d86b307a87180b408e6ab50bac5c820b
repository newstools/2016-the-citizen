Dar es Salaam. Ruvu Shooting s Abdulrahman Musa is confident that he will have playing time for Taifa Stars despite failing to make his debut during the Sunday s friendly match against Zimbabwe.Musa, who has netted six goals in the first half of the Vodacom Premier League season, earned his first call-up, but could not make the cut in the final squad that flew to Harare.Stars tumbled to a 3-0 defeat the hands of the Warriors.Despite being left out, Musa believes that coach Charles Mkwasa will be called up again and get his first cap for the national team. I was left in total disappointment when I learnt that I was not going to Zimbabwe. However, I know that there are better players than me in the squad, so I will keep on working hard and hopefully, Mkwasa will give the chance again, Musa said. The call-up alone spoke volumes. I am a good player and I am dying to put on the national team jersey one day. I want to represent my country in various football competitions. Musa could not dislodge Mbwana Samatta, Thomas Ulimwengu, Elias Maguli and other home based strikers for the Harare trip.
