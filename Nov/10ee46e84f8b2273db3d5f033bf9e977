Democratic Alliance MPs left the National Assembly in a huff on Tuesday morning after refusing to take back a statement referring to President Jacob Zuma as JZ 783 . This was after speaker Baleka Mbete ruled that referring to the president and the 783 charges of corruption and fraud levelled against him was derogatory . Mbete cited rules of the National Assembly, but DA chief whip John Steenhuisen charged that since it was a joint sitting, with both National Assembly and National Council of Provinces MPs in attendance, the particular rules didn t apply. DA MP Denise Robinson, who made the remarks, was loudly backed by her colleagues in the benches when she flat out refused to take her comment back. Madam speaker, you are a joke, said Steenhuisen. There is no provision for you to have made the ruling that you have just done. We will see you in court and embarrass you again, he said as a parting shot as he packed up his things and left the chamber with all DA MPs. The joint sitting had been convened to debate the 16 Days of Activism Against Violence Towards Women and Children. The EFF was quick to call a point of order after the majority opposition left with chief whip Floyd Shivambu pointing a finger at Mbete and arguing she was out of order. Mbete retorted: You are not going to scream; you are not to shout at the chair. I forbid you you are being rude.
