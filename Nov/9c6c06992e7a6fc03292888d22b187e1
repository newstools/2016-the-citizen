In the light of the current ill winds blowing through the National Prosecuting Authority, it has to be a matter of bemused conjecture why anyone would want the office in the first place. The national director of public prosecutions, Shaun Abrahams, and Gauteng director of public prosecutions Sibongile Mzinyathi and special director Tori Pretorius, were on Tuesday given two weeks by President Jacob Zuma to make representations why they should not be suspended. A bitter exchange of correspondence between Hawks boss Lieutenant-General Berning Ntlemeza has also come to light. This represents just another episode in an almost bizarre chain of carnage among those who have held the office since Bulelani Ngcuka was appointed the first director of public prosecutions on July 16, 1998. Ngcuka was to resign his post to president Thabo Mbeki in 2004, under what was believed to be extreme pressure from the ANC for his involvement in the decision to prosecute Zuma for corruption amid unproven allegations that he had been an apartheid spy. Since then seven directors, including Abrahams, have held the office. The post, it would seem, is not what would be regarded as a secure career path. Abrahams has been under fire for announcing, then dropping, fraud charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, former Sars commissioner Oupa Magashula and former deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay. It was met with something approaching horror by the world s financial markets and led to the Helen Suzman Foundation and Freedom Under Law requesting the president to suspend Abrahams for the decision to prosecute Gordhan and his co-accused. Zuma s directive followed. But with multiple charges of corruption, fraud and racketeering hanging over Zuma s head it would be too easy for the cynics to suggest that Zuma had 783 reasons for moving against Abrahams.
