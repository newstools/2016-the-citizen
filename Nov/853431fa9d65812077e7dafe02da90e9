Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema has shown us it is possible to appreciate good music despite what you may think of the label behind it. Malema took to Twitter on Wednesday to compliment Mabala Noise&#8217;s Major League DJs and said their music was &#8220;proper&#8221;. &#8220;Boys and Boys, the problem is Mabala Noise,&#8221; he said. Boys and Boys, the problem is Mabala Noise but otherwise the music is proper @MAJORLEAGUEDJZ pic.twitter.com/1PDAEQu1Jc &mdash; Julius Sello Malema (@Julius_S_Malema) November 9, 2016 The record label made headlines in the past few months after signing many artists, including the DJs, Khanyi Mbau and Nasty C, to name a few. The move shocked South Africans who wondered what was so special about the label and why artists would want to sign with them. Malema answered their questions, accusing the stable of giving each artist they had signed R5 million. The stable, owned by ANC Youth League treasurer Reggie Nkabinde and DJ Bongz, denied the allegations, telling Malema to bring evidence to support his claims.

Just as we were still wondering what would become of the allegations, Metro FM show host and musician Mbau came out and told South Africans that Mabala Noise had given their artists &#8220;lots of money&#8221;, though she said the figure Malema gave us was wrong. &#8220;Look, I won&#8217;t say how much it is, but we got a lot of money. No one in our stable is hungry. They look after us. They treat us like stars, they make sure we live in good neighbourhoods, drive nice cars, wear nice clothing. They believe in us. The R5 million is a wrong figure, but I won&#8217;t say how much, but it&#8217;s an amount that changes lives, yes,&#8221; she said at the time.
