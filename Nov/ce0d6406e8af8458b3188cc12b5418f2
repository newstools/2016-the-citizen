Daily Sun has reported on yet another pastor with a &#8220;shocking approach&#8221; to religion. According to the tabloid, a pastor from Hammanskraal in Tshwane released a video showing him telling a church member to be shocked by a live electric wire as a supposed act of faith. He reportedly claims that if they have enough faith, they will escape electrocution. It reports that, on Sunday, 25-year-old Apostle Phillip Sithole, known as Hephzibah, allegedly also claimed to turn water into wine, mimicking Jesus&#8217; first biblical miracle. Someone who drank this &#8220;wine&#8221; then supposedly got drunk. Daily Sun says it has discovered that the so-called Doom pastor, Prophet Lethebo Rabalago, is the son of Pastor Lesego Daniel, who &#8220;made headlines across the country in 2014 when he ordered his congregation to eat grass&#8221;. Hephizbah, Daily Sun claims, was trained by Daniel; he told the tabloid that his Divine Word Ministries were anointed by God. I can command people to touch live wires and they will not get electrocuted. Anointing is more powerful than live wires, the tabloid quoted him as saying. Watch the video below:
