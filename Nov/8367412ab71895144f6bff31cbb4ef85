It was a little more work than he anticipated, but the result was the one Sunshine Tour campaigner Jaco Prinsloo was hoping for. The Centurion player squandered a two-stroke lead early in the final round, but came back to triumph in a playoff over NJ Arnoldi in the IGT Tour s Race to Q-School #6 on Wednesday. Arnoldi produced a 69 in very windy conditions at Irene Country Club to set the clubhouse target at eight-under-par 208. Prinsloo, at six under after a bogey at 16, needed two shots just to get into the playoff, but for a third successive day, the 27-year-old KwaZulu-Natal native closed with back-to-back birdies to force the tournament into extra time with an even-par 72. The pair halved the par-four first in pars and they were still deadlocked after pars at the eighth. Prinsloo conjured up a superb up-and-down from the greenside bunker at the ninth for a birdie to capture his fourth victory on the country s premier golf development circuit. NJ and I both hit drivers at the ninth, but his ball came to rest very close to a fairway bunker, Prinsloo said. He had a really awkward stance and had to lay up, so I tried to go for the green but pulled a 3-iron into the bunker short of the green. NJ hit his third over the green and I knew I had to make the trap-shot count. I splashed out to six feet and holed the putt for the win. The GFG Academy player was delighted with the result shortly before the Lion of Africa Cape Town Open. It was a real scramble, but I m so pleased that I pulled it through, he said. I had a two week break and I wasn t sure how I d do this week, but I managed to lead from start to finish and nail it in the end. The conditions were really trying and the wind gusted stronger than any other day this week. I missed a few fairways and greens, but I saved a lot of pars with the putter and that gives me a lot of confidence for Cape Town. After a birdie start to the final round, Prinsloo dropped shots at five and 10 and bogeyed the par-three 16th before finishing with successive birdies. I misjudged the wind at the 16th and overshot the green, he said. I left the first chip short and then chipped into the fringe, but I boxed the 10-footer to limit the damage to just one shot. Going down the last two holes, I knew I needed a birdie-birdie finish to at least have a chance. Those two holes were kind to me all week and they didn t disappoint. It really enjoyed going great to head-to-head with NJ in the play-off. He is a stand-up guy and always up for a fight. He told me he is heading to Asia in January for the Second Stage Qualifier for the Asian Tour. I wish him well and I hope he has a really great week out there. Ruhan van Dijk from Kempton Park banked R500 for producing the low round of the day, a five under 67 that saw the 19-year-old finish in a tie for third at six under 210 with fellow amateur Stephan Erasmus, who returned a 71. &nbsp; Final Result All competitors RSA unless otherwise specified and amateurs indicated as AMA. 208 &#8211; Jaco Prinsloo 67 69 72 (first play-off hole) 208 &#8211; NJ Arnoldi 72 67 69 210 &#8211; Ruhan Van Dijk AMA 68 75 67, Stephan Erasmus AMA 70 69 71 211 &#8211; John McClean (NIR) 68 70 73 212 &#8211; Ivanna Samu AMA 68 74 70, Michael Kok AMA 73 67 72 213 &#8211; Juan Langeveld 69 73 71, Russel Franz 68 74 71 214 &#8211; Conway Kunneke 75 69 70, CJ Levey 70 73 71, Gregg Blainey (ENG) 70 71 73, Albert Venter AMA 67 73 74 215 &#8211; Leon Visser AMA 74 69 72, Gary Daoust (BEL) 72 70 73, Paul De Beer 71 69 75, Coert Groenewald 72 67 76 216 &#8211; Quintin Crause 70 72 74, Tristen Strydom 71 69 76, Ruan Potgieter AMA 70 70 76, Estiaan Conradie AMA 72 66 78 217 &#8211; Terence Boardman 74 71 72, Keanu Pestana AMA 73 72 72, Paul Boshoff AMA 70 72 75, Justin Turner 68 71 78 218 &#8211; Stefan Labuschagne AMA 72 72 74, Carrie Park 75 70 73, Arno Pretorius AMA 74 72 72, David Ashley (ENG) 71 70 77, Hendrikus Stoop AMA 75 72 71 219 &#8211; Jonathan Waschefort 76 70 73 220 &#8211; Clinton Cheia 72 72 76, Dylan Kok AMA 73 73 74, LJ Lowies AMA 71 71 78, Dean O&#8217;Riley 76 71 73 221 &#8211; Tom Watson AMA 73 72 76, Matthew Spacey 75 71 75, Andrew Carlsson AMA 67 76 78, Bertine Strauss 72 74 75, Clinton Grobler 74 73 74, Angus Ellis-Cole AMA 71 76 74, Philip Geerts AMA (ITA) 74 75 72 222 &#8211; Driekus Gous AMA 75 71 76, Johary Raveloarison (MDG) 74 72 76, Maritz Wessels 72 70 80, Dwayne Coetzee 71 75 76, Werner Van Wyk 77 71 74 223 &#8211; Wayne Stroebel 72 72 79 224 &#8211; Michael Faasen AMA 74 72 78, Kyle Barker 73 73 78, Bryce Myburgh 69 77 78, Dayne Moore (ZAM) 75 72 77, Shalan Govender 76 72 76, Matthew Vogel 73 76 75, Bradley Diggeden AMA 75 74 75 225 &#8211; Stephan De Beer 75 70 80, Jacques De Villiers 70 76 79, Chris Haefele 75 72 78, Theunis Bezuidenhout AMA 76 73 76, Louis Albertse AMA 77 72 76 226 &#8211; Brendan Britten (NAM) 71 74 81, Michael Schutz 83 66 77 228 &#8211; Jadrick Fourie AMA 76 72 80, Jandre Fullard 75 74 79 230 &#8211; Bonita Bredenhann (NAM) 77 69 84 232 &#8211; Armand Azar AMA 76 72 84 233 &#8211; Alex Van Heerden AMA 74 75 84 RTD &#8211; Ruan Conradie AMA 73 71 RTD
