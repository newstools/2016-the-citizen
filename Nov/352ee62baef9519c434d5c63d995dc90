Former Metro FM DJ T-Bo Touch recently revealed he was earning about R200 000 per month towards the end of his stint at Metro FM. Touch, real name Thabo Molefe, revealed this relatively huge figure during an interview with Thabo T-Bose Mokwele on Kaya FM, adding his remuneration figure was a nice one. Metro FM is one of the SABC&#8217;s commercial radio stations and is believed to make the public broadcaster a lot of money. However, these stations are reportedly now struggling after losing listeners and ad revenue due to a decision to broadcast 90% local content. Even EFF leader Julius Malema, normally a proudly local ambassador, tweeted last month that he could no longer listen to the station.

The Touch Central host went on to say that leaving at his peak and earning what he labelled the biggest pay cheque at the station was not a decision motivated by financial reasons but made out of principle. The controversial radio DJ was once suspended from his show for his alleged refusal to read an advert online; he later relived the experience to CliffCentral, saying the real reason was because he refused to remove certain features from his show. Touch left Metro FM earlier this year and went on to launch Touch Central, a collaboration with another radio and TV personality, Gareth Cliff.
