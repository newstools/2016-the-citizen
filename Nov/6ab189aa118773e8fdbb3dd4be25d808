The Democratic Alliance (DA) has called for payment provider SmartPurse to be fired following the company s late payment of Community Health Workers (CHWs) in Gauteng. In a statement on Wednesday, DA MPL Jack Bloom said: SmartPurse should be fired as they have not solved the long-standing problem of late payment to CHWs . Bloom said the health workers had been informed that they would not be paid at the end of November and instead would only get their pay on December 6. According to the DA, SmartPurse is being paid R87 million to make payouts to about 7,000 CHWs every month for a period of three years. Gauteng Health department spokesperson Steve Mabona said: We are aware of the delay in payment of CHWs and we are resolving the matter and have apologised for the delay and inconvenience. CHWs will be paid by Friday. ALSO READ: Birth control can be linked to depression, anxiety Mabona said that the CHWs would receive their December stipends before Christmas. Bloom said the planned late payment was outrageous as CHWs only get paid a R2,500 stipend and they have bills to pay like everyone else. They are expected to play a key role in preventing and treating HIV/Aids, but will now be unpaid tomorrow [Thursday] on World AIDS day, lamented Bloom. He said one of the CHWs had said in a WhatsApp message: They really don t care, people are going to be homeless, no food for our kids, no Christmas clothes. SmartPurse could not be reached for comment. African News Agency For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
