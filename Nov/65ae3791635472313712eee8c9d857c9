Bulelwa &#8216;Zahara&#8217; Mkutukana&#8217;s boyfriend, Amaza Ntshanga, has reportedly not paid lobola for the Loliwe hitmaker. This despite her saying that he had done so about three weeks ago. The two did, however, travel to her hometown, Phumulani village, near East London, for lobola negotiations that left the two families in disagreement. The two families sat for hours negotiating but could not agree on the price, leaving Zahara angry, as she did not anticipate the misunderstanding, Drum reported. Ntshanga did not accept an amount that was less than what the couple had agreed on, saying he could not afford it. A source who reportedly spoke to the publication and was part of the delegation said Zahara lied about the lobola because she was embarrassed and ashamed . Though her sisters confirmed the negotiations took place, they could not comment on the success of the negotiations. The two have, however, shown their fans that the negotiations may have failed, but they are still very much together, and perhaps Ntshanga might pay for lobola sooner than we think. He took to Instagram on Wednesday to share that he had cooked for his &#8220;Queen&#8221;. &#8220;When you cook for your Queen special person in your life and they say &#8216;ndicela ukuyiva k&#8217;qaka&#8216; (may I taste it first?). Zahara had previously said preparations for a ceremony to welcome the son-in-law into the Mkutukana family were already under way. Though she did not want a big wedding, she said her family insisted on a big celebration, and Top Billing asked to cover it. The couple have not decided on the date of the white wedding yet but she said it was likely to take place in the first quarter of 2017. Read more: Zahara is getting married
