On Friday on his New York-based news-commentary satire show The Daily Show, Trevor Noah took the opportunity to punt his book, Born a Crime and Other Stories. You can watch the video here. He said the reason was to explain himself to his American audience. &#8220;I know that I popped up in a lot of people&#8217;s lives out of nowhere when it came to The Daily Show. A lot of people asked me questions like &#8216;where the hell are you from?&#8217;; &#8216;why do you speak the way you do?&#8217;; &#8216;why do you look the way you do?&#8217;; &#8216;if you&#8217;re from Africa why does your skin look the way it does?&#8217;.&#8221; He said that these questions were part of the reason he wrote the book, which is mostly a series of vignettes from his life covering some of his personal observations while telling personal stories. It has so far received praise from critics. The book launched worldwide this month.
