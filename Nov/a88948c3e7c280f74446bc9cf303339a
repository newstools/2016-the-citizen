Parliament s ad hoc committee conducting an inquiry into the embattled South African Broadcasting Corporation has written to Police Minister Nathi Nhleko asking that he advise them on what kind of protection would be available to witnesses testifying in the inquiry. In a statement issued on Thursday, the committee said it condemned in the strongest possible terms acts of intimidation directed at SABC journalists (the so-called SABC 8). Seven of the eight journalists, who were sacked earlier this year for speaking out about censorship at the broadcaster, were reinstated after they approached the Labour Court. They are among the witnesses to be called to testify in the inquiry. Following our inaugural meeting, we have written a letter to the Minister of Police, Mr Nkosinathi Nhleko, requesting that he investigate and advise on what kind of protection is available to those journalists and all other potential witnesses that are to appear before the ad hoc committee, who may be targeted, said ad hoc committee chairman Vincent Smith.

The committee said it believed the SA Police Service would urgently address the matter. The committee is concerned that if left unattended, these occurrences may spiral out of hand and result in the loss of innocent lives, the statement said. The committee further believes that any kind of intimidation is against the spirit of whistle blowing, which is about exposing maladministration and corruption in government departments and entities. &#8211; African News Agency
