Raven Klaasen and US partner Rajeev Ram bounced back from a defeat two days earlier, snatching a superb victory on Friday evening to reach the penultimate round of the doubles competition at the ATP World Tour Finals in London. Klaasen and Ram defeated Spaniards Marc and Feliciano Lopez 6-3 7-6 (8) to finish the group stage with two wins from three matches. The duo, who entered the eight-team tournament as the No 7 seeds, were set to face Scotland&#8217;s Jamie Murray and Brazilian Bruno Soares, the No 2 seeds after winning the Australian Open and US Open titles this season, in the semifinals. Should Klaasen reach the final of the year-end competition with Ram, he would become the first SA player to do so in more than 14 years.
