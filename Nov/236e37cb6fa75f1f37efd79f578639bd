Former Gauteng premier, ANC member and founder of the Congress of the People Mbhazima Shilowa took to Twitter on Sunday to mock State Security Minister David Mahlobo and his predecessor at the agency Siyabonga Cwele. Cwele&#8217;s wife was sentenced to prison for dealing in cocaine, which her husband famously apparently knew nothing about her complicated operation, despite being the minister of &#8220;state security&#8221;. The Constitutional Court reduced Sheryl Cwele&#8217;s prison term from 20 years to 12 years in 2013. By then she was the minister&#8217;s ex-wife. She is still serving her sentence. Mahlobo was implicated in an Al Jazeera documentary as being chummy with a Chinese rhino poaching trafficker and was also implicated as the possible reason poachers were not prosecuted despite being caught red-handed.

Shilowa, however, joked that we should not be so hard on the man, since the Chinese man in the documentary is only his friend, not his wife. South Africans are really unfair. How could a Mahlobo know what his poacher friend is up to when Cwele didn&#39;t know what wife was up to! https://t.co/06L4BXpm2o &mdash; Mbhazima Shilowa (@Enghumbhini) November 13, 2016 Others on Twitter were equally ruthless: Waiting for ANCYL and ANCWL to accuse Al Jazeera of being apart of White Media.

Will he do a Molefe? https://t.co/hRtPuPxzpr &mdash; Don Fraser (@donscot23) November 13, 2016 I pray that Jimmy Manyi will not say Al Jazeera hates black ministers like David Mahlobo as it were. &mdash; Hloni Nyetanyane (@HloniNyetanyane) November 13, 2016 Some will argue that what David Mahlobo allegedly did, Whites have been doing it for years and its okay for him to do it. #PaidTwitter &mdash; Ndumiso M (@AwesomeSnowman) November 13, 2016 David mahlobo must be arrested immediately &mdash; vaalboi (@KodisangTello) November 13, 2016 &nbsp;
