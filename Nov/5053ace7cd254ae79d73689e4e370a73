A man who picked up a sex worker and accompanied her to her flat for a roll in the hay got more than he bargained for when he was subsequently robbed of his car. Sunnyside police spokesperson Captain Augustinah Selepe said the man picked up a 22-year-old woman in the streets of Sunnyside last Wednesday night. &#8220;They agreed on a transaction and proceeded to the Tambotie Flats where the woman stayed,&#8221; Selepe said. She said the woman left her client for a moment, and when she returned she was with four other men. &#8220;They demanded the client&#8217;s car keys and cash before leaving the flat. The men returned minutes later and handed back the keys to the client,&#8221; she said. Selepe said before the men finally left, they instructed the client not to leave and to wait on orders. &#8220;The client later noticed someone driving away with his car.&#8221; Also read: Sex worker steals wife s clothes while man sleeps As soon as he got out of the flat, he reported the incident to the police. Police followed up on information from their local informers and, a day later, on Thursday night, they arrested the sex worker at Tambotie Flats. &#8220;Further investigations led to the arrests of two foreign nationals aged between 30 and 34 years the very next day,&#8221; Selepe said. He said their records had shown that men were drugged and robbed in the past after picking up a sex worker. She warned motorists to resist the temptation of picking up women in the streets.
