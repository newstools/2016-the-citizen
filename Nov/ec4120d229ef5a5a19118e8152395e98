The Sunday Times attempted to find out this week whether outgoing Eskom CEO Brian Molefe may still get to pocket his R9.5 million bonus, which should only have been due to him in June 2018 &#8220;if he met his performance requirements&#8221;. It appears the decision still needs to be made. The paper alleged the amount could be paid out to him in January after only 18 months of work once he had served his notice period. Molefe resigned in the wake of a scandal linking him to the controversial Gupta family and a deal that favoured their mining company, Tegeta, without proper tender procedures being followed. Molefe&#8217;s bonus is related to more than 7.5 million shares he was given last year in April when he took the reins at the troubled power utility. The shares were meant to be part of long-term financial incentives for executives. Eskom policy also states that Molefe, and all executives, should have to forfeit their shares if they don&#8217;t see out their terms, unless there are &#8220;other permitted reasons&#8221; for why they should be paid out. Molefe was meant to remain as CEO for at least three years to qualify. Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown&#8217;s spokesperson said the matter was still being processed and they could not comment, while Eskom chairperson Ben Ngubane said that even if he would personally have wanted to give the bonus to Molefe, who he has staunchly cheered and defended, the right policy would need to be followed. The Sunday Times also reported that Molefe has a property portfolio worth more than R31 million, including two farms, which are &#8220;partly bonded&#8221;.
