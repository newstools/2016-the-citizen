Police have launched a manhunt for six men who kidnapped four children from the TLC children s home in Eikenhof, in Johannesburg south, Gauteng police said. Police spokesperson Kay Makhubela said that no arrests were made after the men hijacked an ambulance on Wednesday, before kidnapping the children. The six males called an ambulance and lied to paramedics that a woman was in labour pains and needed to be transported to the nearest hospital. When the paramedics arrived, they were robbed and hijacked by the six suspects. The men pointed the driver with a gun and demanded his uniform and control of the vehicle, Makhubela said. The suspects drove to the children s home where they, at gunpoint, demanded entry to the premises. Upon entering the children s home, they saw four boys whom they pointed with a gun and demanded they tell them where the money is. They further asked the children if there was anyone armed at the premise. ALSO READ: Trio wanted for uMhlanga robbery in KZN Makhubela said the men took the four children and drove away.
