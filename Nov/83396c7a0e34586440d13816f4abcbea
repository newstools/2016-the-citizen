The current generation of the Toyota Hilux has been around since February this year, with sales of up to 30 000 units since introduction that proves clearly how South Africans love, respect and trust the &#8216;bakkie&#8217;. The Japanese has recently introduced its upgraded Hilux SRX models, which boast the most significant styling cues compared to the previous model. . The upgraded Hilux is now much wider, taller and more prominent. As seen in the existing Raider models, the new Hilux brings along a bold, integrated over-fender paired with a wider front bumper design. This reprofiled exterior adds 55mm to the width of Single-cab and Double-cab SRX derivatives (up to 1855mm). Xtra-cab models already boast the &#8216;wide-body&#8217; construction, and as such, all three body shapes now share the same exterior width dimension. The exterior mirrors inherit turn signal lamps, while retaining the durable matte black treatment and electric adjustment. . The exterior fa ade is enhanced with a change to wider-track 17&#8243; alloy wheels (previously steel wheels), shod with 265/65/R17 all-terrain rubber (an increase from the current 225/70/R17 specified items). As many fitness enthusiasts will testify to, it&#8217;s all about the gains. In this regard the &#8216;pumped-up&#8217; SRX&#8217;s vital stats definitely measure. The latest round of upgrades to the Hilux SRX positions it to occupy a unique space in the LCV market. While retaining its go-anywhere, do-anything utility credentials, the SRX derivatives now incorporate enhanced exterior styling which are sure to appeal to the leisure buyer as well. The new SRX package perfectly complements the sublimely capable 110kW, 400Nm 2.4 litre GD-6 engine (or 2.7 litre petrol VVTi powerplant) and delivers a bakkie that will work hard in the week, while allowing its owners to play just as hard over weekends too and look good doing it. . On this note, all 2.8 GD-6 and 4.0 V6 Fortuner models are now equipped with striking 18&#8243; alloy wheels. Replacing the previously employed 17&#8243; version, the new alloys are fitted with 265/60/R18 rubber and make use of distinctive counterflowing spokes, with a machined finish accentuating the dual-dimensional design. The entry-level 2.7 VVTi and 2.4 GD-6 models retain the stylish 17&#8243; &#8216;dual rib&#8217; alloy wheels. As an additional bonus, the 2.7 VVTi and 2.4 GD-6 Fortuner derivatives are furnished with leather interior trim, replacing the current textile offering. This luxurious appointment is provided at no cost to the customer, boosting the already high-value proposition significantly.
