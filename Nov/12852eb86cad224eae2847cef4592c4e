The South African Institute of Race Relations has been at the forefront of combating racism and hate speech for many years, championing what was often considered an unpopular cause in the dark days of deep divisions along ethnic lines. The institute s call this week for a tougher and more trustworthy justice system to deal with the plague which pulses malignantly beneath the surface, is a much needed one. The racial connotations inherent in the Middelburg coffin case have done little to mollify the sensitivities of a nation still struggling hesitantly to come to terms with the diverse spread of identities which make us both so special and often untrusting of exactly where our long-held loyalties truly lie. For South Africans all South Africans to rely on the sustainable sanity of collective citizenship, any action which could erode the fragile bonds of Ubuntu, must be strictly policed and rapidly brought to the courts. But it is equally right that the questions be asked. Hopefully the lasting answers lie in the hearts and minds of the multi-hued mobs of children happily competing against one another at primary school level. Racism is a learned reflex, one that the courts must help imbue in our national psyche.
