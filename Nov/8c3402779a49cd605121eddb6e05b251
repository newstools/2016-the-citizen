Singer Kelly Khumalo has slammed reports claiming she is pregnant with Khaya Mthethwa&#8217;s baby, calling the reports &#8220;hurtful&#8221;. &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand why or how people can be so hurtful. I am not dating anyone, I am not pregnant,&#8221; she said on Twitter, further saying she was not &#8220;your social media toy&#8221;. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been so busy promoting my new album My Truth around the country that I&#8217;ve hardly had time to myself. What I find most concerning are the comments on social media on this fabricated issue from women. &#8220;I would like to categorically state that I am not dating anyone at the moment. Khaya Mthethwa is an industry friend who I happened to take a selfie with at a show we were both working on. I am not pregnant with anyone&#8217;s child,&#8221; she said in a statement. Khumalo&#8217;s management agency said they were aware of the rumours doing the rounds and would take legal action against the site that ran the story.

I am not your social media toy. pic.twitter.com/js5DP5fjVy &mdash; Kelly Khumalo (@KellyKhumaloZA) November 14, 2016 The Asine hit maker made headlines last week after posting a picture of herself with Idols SA winner Khaya Mthethwa, calling him &#8220;bae&#8221;, but Mthethwa on Twitter was immediately warned against dating her. Most of the comments were tongue-in-cheek advance condolences to Mthethwa&#8217;s family, saying his &#8220;application for a death certificate was pending&#8221;. Khumalo has previously been called &#8220;babes wokufa&#8221; (babes of death) &#8211; she has had two ex-boyfriends, Prosper Mkwaiwa and Senzo Meyiwa, who both died young and tragically. But Khumalo said she was laughing at the &#8220;stupidity&#8221; of the comments about Mthethwa dying soon because he was her &#8220;bae&#8221;. &#8220;Twitter folks are so predictable, I&#8217;m sitting laughing my lungs out on how stupid ya&#8217;ll can be,&#8221; she said, receiving yet more negative comments from fans, who said it was a pity Meyiwa was not there to share the laughter with her. &#8220;Pity Senzo isn&#8217;t here to share the laughter with you,&#8221; one said.
