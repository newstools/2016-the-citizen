Danilo Acquisto has joined Red Nose South Africa. Child Welfare SA and RU1 have joined forces with the Enough is Enough Association for the 2016-2017 Red Nose Day campaign in a bid to raise R8 million of much needed funds for local children. Red Nose Day is a fun-filled way to raise awareness and funds for those children who are less fortunate in their lives. This will be done through a series of events hosted over six months, culminating in a nationwide celebration in May. The first fundraising event will be the inflatable obstacle course, called Be Gung Ho, to be held in Cape Town on February 11, followed by a charity comedy show later in the month. Acquisto will join Chad Saaiman, Siv Ngesi, Angel Campey, Tumi Morake, Kagiso Mokgadi, Yaaseen Barnes, Henno William, Schalk Bezuidenhout and Armand du Plessis in the campaign. I am so honoured and excited to be a part of Red Nose South Africa. I m so excited that it s back, said TV and radio presenter Acquisto. Empowering the youth of the country has always been a massive part of my journey and I have had a myriad of heartbreaking experiences with children who have the biggest hearts and are in desperate need of care. I now get to use my voice to make a tangible impact in the lives of young people and to do it in the best way I know how through joy. Our kids need us so desperately and we all need to do something however small to provide someone else with an opportunity or the resources to get a little closer to achieving their dreams, and being the best versions of themselves they can be. I encourage all South Africans to join me. South Africa, are you with me? Proceeds of Red Nose Day will benefit various children s rights NGOs.
