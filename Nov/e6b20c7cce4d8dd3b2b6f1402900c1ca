The search for three-year-old Everlate Chauke who was swept away by the raging Jukskei River in Alexandra would resume on Friday, Johannesburg emergency services said. Her father had carried her and went up a tree on Wednesday to escape the raging water when the tree broke and the little girl slipped away into the river. Rescue teams searched the river across Alexandra and neighbouring areas on Thursday. The Chaukes were one of the many families left homeless as the river burst its banks and swept shacks away in one of the worst storms to hit Johannesburg on Wednesday. Most sought overnight shelter with friends or relatives after losing all their belongings.

He announced that the residents, some of whom had been living along the river banks for over ten years, would have to be relocated to a safer place. The immediate concern of the government is to attend to the immediate needs of the displaced residents. Government will work with the local community to find temporary shelter and provide basic needs for the families, Mashatile said. Most of the people whose houses were swept away by the floods live on the flood line along the Jukskei river bank. Mashatile announced that all those residents will have to be relocated to a safer area. We are saddened by this incident and we extended our sincerest condolences to families that lost their loved ones as a result of these flash floods. African News Agency
