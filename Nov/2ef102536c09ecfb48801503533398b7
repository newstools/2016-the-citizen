There is a growing upsurge of belief that in this country there are three types of law: one for the rich, another for the poor and a third for President Jacob Zuma. This must be most keenly felt among the indigent and financially underprivileged, who are sometimes made to linger in custody for years as awaiting trial prisoners because they cannot scratch together the most rudimentary of bail demands. The rich have always had the benefit of being able to call on, and pay, the best legal minds available. It must be emphasised at this juncture that the courts are largely ruled by the law of precedent, which underpins our legal system, and careering towards collapse under staggering caseloads and at times burdened even further by inept investigatory findings. But the insistence by the president and his legal advisers that he cannot be held personally liable for the costs of bringing a high court interdict subsequently withdrawn by Zuma to block the release of former public protector Thuli Madonsela s State of Capture report, has not gone unchallenged by the opposition. It must be added that this will surely engender a new episode in the pay back the money furore over the filibustering over who should be financially responsible for the lavish upgrades to Zuma s Nkandla homestead. Zuma has consistently avoided the courts when it seems to be disadvantageous; he has still to face 783 counts of fraud, corruption and racketeering against him. His haste to follow the legal route over the payment over the abandoned interdict would, ironically, not seem out of character. Invoking the State Liability Act, Zuma contended in high court papers that Madonsela s report named him in his presidential capacity and that made it the responsibility of the presidency. Whichever way you cut it, though, the public, who pay the president, will ultimately bear the cost.
