The International Cricket Council (ICC) has charged Proteas stand-in captain Faf du Plessis for &#8220;changing the condition of the ball&#8221; in the second Test against Australia in Hobart. Du Plessis was seen rubbing his finger on to a mint in his mouth and then shining the ball repeatedly, which may be illegal since the laws say you can only use regular saliva, not saliva enhanced by any artificial substance to shine the ball. The Proteas took a wicket with their next ball after the incident. Du Plessis has pleaded &#8220;not guilty&#8221; to the charge. &nbsp; All level 2 breaches, where this charge falls within the ICC rules and regulations, carry an imposition of a fine between 50% to 100% of the applicable match fee and/or up to two suspension points, and three or four demerit points. The South African team is reportedly considering flying a lawyer from South Africa to Australia, once the date of the hearing against Du Plessis has been set. The Sydney Morning Herald is reporting that the SA team is standing behind the captain. &#8220;The reason everyone is here is to stand together, really, and to show solidarity to something &#8230; we thought was actually a joke,&#8221; batsman Hashim Amla was reported as saying. &#8220;It&#8217;s not April, but the allegation against Faf was &#8230; a really ridiculous thing. As a team, we&#8217;re standing strong, we&#8217;ve done nothing wrong. &#8220;It&#8217;s basically a joke. I chew bubblegum while I&#8217;m on the field &#8211; you want me to brush my teeth after lunch? &#8220;We&#8217;re standing out on the field for two hours &#8230; there was no malicious intent whatsoever &#8230; I&#8217;ve had sweets in my mouth, bubblegum in my mouth, biltong, nuts &#8211; I&#8217;m not sure what the big deal is.&#8221;
