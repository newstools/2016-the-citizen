Refiloe &#8216;Cassper Nyovest&#8217; Phoolo has previously opened up about how his success at some point changed him, almost ruining his relationship with his parents, saying they were not talking anymore. But all that seems to have changed, as he has often been posting pictures of his mother, Muzuki Phoolo, saying she had been supporting him even when no one believed he would be able to Fill Up the Dome and recently, Orlando Stadium. He has also shared with his fans that his &#8220;gorgeous&#8221; sisters showed him support. &#8220;I literally feel like i can do anything when I have these 3 behind me.&#8221; Mom and my gorgeous sisters showing support.

Things turned weird earlier this year when musician Penny Penny allegedly claimed he was the rapper&#8217;s father. The claim reportedly infuriated the rapper&#8217;s mother so much that she filed a R1.5-million lawsuit against Penny Penny and the publication that published the story.

Responding to the lawsuit, Penny Penny said he had nothing to do with the article, accusing the publication of lying. He said he never told the magazine that Cassper was his son, reported Sunday World. Cassper has finally shut down all rumours surrounding his father by sharing a picture of himself and his parents wearing Cassper Nyovest-branded T-shirts with the caption: &#8220;I&#8217;m a product of love.&#8221; Meet your favourite rapper&#8217;s parents Muzuki and Letsebela Phoolo. I&#8217;m a product of love. A photo posted by Refiloe Phoolo &#x1f1ff;&#x1f1e6; (@casspernyovest) on Nov 21, 2016 at 8:32am PST
