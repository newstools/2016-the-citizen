Natural disasters drive at least 26 million people into poverty each year and cause more than 500 billion in lost consumption, far exceeding the value of damage to property alone, according to a World Bank report released Monday. Those numbers will be driven up in the coming decades as climate change amplifies the destructive power of cyclones, flooding and drought, said the report, released on the margins of high-level UN climate talks in Marrakesh.
