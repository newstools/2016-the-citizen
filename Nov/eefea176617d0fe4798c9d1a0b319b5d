Kwaito musician Thokozani Ndlovu, popularly known as L&#8217;vovo Derrango, is the latest to join the list of celebrities who have answered their sangoma calling. The kwaito heavyweight has recently been sharing videos and pictures of his journey on Instagram. Watch the video he shared with his fans below: Thank u to @ngizwemchunu and his wife @flodasa for coming makhosi amakhulu A video posted by Lvovo Derrango (@lvovosa) on Nov 28, 2016 at 9:30pm PST L&#8217;vovo went on a five-month spiritual journey in June in KwaZulu-Natal because it was an instruction his grandmother received, which he had to honour. He told Daily Sun he did not want to be a sangoma and only did it for his grandmother. Though he won&#8217;t be practising as a sangoma, he said he could not ignore his spiritual calling, as he respected his religion and culture. He further told the tabloid he would continue to do what he did best: entertaining his fans. This year alone has seen a number of celebrities finally answering their sangoma calling and being open about it with their fans. Model and presenter Boitumelo &#8216;Boity&#8217; Thulo answered her calling earlier this year and went through her own spiritual journey. Being secretive as she is, she only opened up about her calling after fans started asking about a white bracelets she was always wearing. They Called. I Answered. &#x1f451; The Proudest, most Incredible day of my life. A Beautiful Gift that I will never take for granted. #ThokozaGogo #KgosigadiDabulamanzi #Blessed #OwnYourThrone&#x1f451; A photo posted by Boitumelo Thulo (@boity) on Jun 18, 2016 at 7:15am PDT &#8220;They Called.

The Soil&#8217;s Buhle Mdaalso took a break from music this year to answer her sangoma calling. The group announced the news on their Facebook page, also calling for her replacement at the time. However, she finished her calling and joined the group again. Other celebrities who have answered their calling include Letoya Makhene, Bongani Masondo, Nandi Nyembe, Lerato Mvelase and Baby Cele, to name a few.
