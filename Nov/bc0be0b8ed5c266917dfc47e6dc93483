For the sports fans in this country, there was the rare uplift of a victory by our national soccer team and the despair at yet another dismal performance by the South African rugby team. In many ways, the two contrasting results have resonance in the lasting schism which still exists in our two most emotive sporting codes and echoes in the highs and lows which have swept across our democracy in recent times. For Bafana Bafana the 2-1 victory in a World Cup qualifier at Polokwane put South Africa top of Group D, gave embattled coach Shakes Mashaba some breathing space and lifted the spirits of this proud nation who have become inured to a singular lack of success on the global stage. In contrast, the Springboks fell 37-21 to England at Twickenham for the first time in a decade in a Test where they were outscored four tries to two by a side coached by the shrewd Australian Eddie Jones, who had read the lack of Springbok strategy and shape to a nicety. But the beauty of sport is that both sides have another date with destiny and we should all stand behind both the proud winners and the despondent losers.
