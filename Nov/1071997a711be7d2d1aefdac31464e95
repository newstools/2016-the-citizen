Two 132KV power lines from Njala to Waltoloo to Rooiwal have been hit by lightning, leaving Tshwane residents in the dark in more than 20 areas. Tshwane spokesperson Lindela Mashigo said residents from Mooikloof in the east of Pretoria right through to Rooiwal, northwest of Pretoria, were in the dark from 7pm on Thursday just as heavy rains started pouring down on the capital. Areas affected included Garsfontein, Silverlakes, Wapadrand, Mamelodi, Eersterust, Silverton, East Lynne, Montana, Doornpoort, Silver Lakes and Weavind Park. &#8220;A team from the department is currently attending to the problem,&#8221; Mashigo said. Tshwane Emergency Services spokesperson Johan Pieterse said they had only responded to one incident where a car was caught up in flood waters on Olympus Road in Centurion. He said no deaths or injuries had been reported and asked people to please be patient.
