It was nothing more than coincidence on Monday night that I had to pause my watching of the final episode of 2016&#8217;s Last Week Tonight with John Oliver partway through and go to the shops. I stopped watching at the point where Oliver was making a heartfelt plea to America and the world to keep in mind that the hopeful advice people have been offering amid their shock to &#8220;give Trump a chance&#8221; might seem appealing, but is deeply problematic. Because giving Trump a chance to try some of his ludicrous ideas (even if many people don&#8217;t really believe he&#8217;s going to do most of them) is dangerous. By the way, if you&#8217;ve never watched John Oliver&#8217;s show, you&#8217;re missing out. Below is a taster of the episode: Said Oliver: &#8220;Giving [Trump] a chance, in the sense of not speaking out immediately against policies that he&#8217;s proposed is dangerous &#8230; because some of them are alarming.&#8221; At another point in the segment, he said: &#8220;Our president-elect has at various times said he&#8217;d bomb civilians, loot oil and waterboard [terrorism suspects].&#8221; All of those things are war crimes, by the way, including Trump&#8217;s (albeit now disputed) campaign vow that he&#8217;ll hunt down the family members of terrorist suspects and kill them too. I understand that just under half of all American voters picked Trump and got him as their president due to the oddness of the Electoral College system, and that those people&#8217;s choice should be respected, as well as their reasons for choosing a populist. But it was obviously a revenge vote against the system: our world has deep problems and people in America who grew up during a time when the US was kicking ass just can&#8217;t deal with the rise of countries like China and India. The balance of global power and economics is shifting and it&#8217;s eroding the white middle class in America. How Wall Street was bailed out by ordinary taxpayers and allowed to get away with the greatest act of irresponsible greed in the history of modern finance was also beyond disgusting. The austerity measures that have been imposed on many countries in the wake of all this perverted so-called &#8220;capitalism&#8221; are equally disgusting. But obviously Trump is not the solution to any of these neoliberal problems (or whatever label you want to slap on them to describe them). His voters, though, clearly thought he was more of an answer than Hillary Clinton, even if a large portion of them were too ashamed to admit they were voting for the orange man. John Oliver has not missed this point: &#8220;Donald Trump will be president and respecting democracy means accepting that, although there is one sentiment that I would argue takes that a little too far&#8230;&#8221; He then showed a montage featuring people saying we should &#8220;give Donald Trump a chance&#8221;. &#8220;Now, in the broadest sense, I get that,&#8221; said Oliver. &#8220;Hope for the best in the face of very long odds&#8230; &#8220;Optimism is nice if you can swing it, but you&#8217;ve got to be careful, because it can feed into the normalisation of Donald Trump, and he is not normal. He is abnormal.&#8221; He reminds us (as if anyone needed any reminding) of the wall on the Mexican border Trump promised he&#8217;d build and somehow get Mexico to pay for; how Trump promised to repeal Obamacare (extended healthcare); deport children; and even ban all Muslims from entering the US. Then while I was standing in the queue at the supermarket with my bag of potatoes, I saw this week&#8217;s cover of You magazine with John Oliver&#8217;s words still ringing in my mind. And there it was, the normalisation of Trump in big red, white and yellow letters. There was even a happy exclamation mark: &#8220;Trump&#8217;s Triumph! His life, his loves &amp; how he&#8217;ll change the world&#8221;. The &#8220;What awaits Donald &amp; Melania&#8221; bit was perhaps the most nauseating to me of all, as if the staff at You magazine commonly refer to these people by their first names, like they&#8217;re all big buddies who&#8217;ll be playing tennis together at the Wanderers this Saturday. . &#8220;Oh, what has Donald said again this week?&#8221; I imagine the features editor saying with a laugh, skinny latte in hand. &#8220;He&#8217;s such a scallywag!&#8221; I realise these are the same guys who write about Ridge and Brooke as though they are real people, so I know I&#8217;m expecting a lot. But Trump is a man who it can never be ignored said the most disgusting things in the name of winning over the forgotten bedrock of America: the disaffected, very racist white person; people like a former Klu Klux Klan leader. Trump&#8217;s construction projects, from the US to Dubai, have regularly been linked to highly exploitative labour practices, and almost everything that has come out of his mouth for the past three or four decades has been a lie. He strategically offended almost every minority in the US and the world, and even he probably didn&#8217;t believe the voting maths would ultimately work for him. It&#8217;s almost as if You somehow forgot that there are black people in South Africa too, and Trump hasn&#8217;t been very complimentary of them either not to mention his direct insults against this country. I had a look at the cover of You&#8216;s sister magazine Drum just to be sure I wasn&#8217;t being oversensitive, and it was also proclaiming &#8220;Trump&#8217;s triumph&#8221; but without the exclamation mark and most anything else that had rubbed me up the wrong way about the You cover. Hmm, I thought. Wonder why that is&#8230; . I bought myself a copy of the You magazine because I wanted to see for myself if the actual article was as nauseating as the cover advertising it. (The last time I had felt quite as much shame at buying a magazine was 20 years ago when I was a spotty 17-year-old at the corner shop down the road in Bloemfontein, and the title in question was wrapped in some see-through plastic and may have contained the words &#8216;Legal&#8217; and &#8216;Barely&#8217;.) Whether or not Trump really is a reincarnated, orange version of Adolf Hitler, we really don&#8217;t know what he is. We can only take him at face value, and at face value he is nothing more than an unapologetic racist fascist who grabs women wherever and whenever he feels the urge to (and doesn&#8217;t think they should have any say on whatever happens to their bodies when it comes to reproductive rights); and he hardly ever apologises for anything. He&#8217;s not just a big, rambunctious, naughty boy. He&#8217;s a volatile egomaniac who is incapable of even considering the possibility that he could be wrong about anything. There are few qualities in anyone I like less than his kind of self-righteousness, because you can&#8217;t negotiate with someone who is simultaneously pig-headed and a pig. No matter which way we may like to spin this thing, the world is in trouble because Donald Trump will be in the White House. The American experiment is bubbling and on fire, and the science class is in danger of burning down. &#8220;Trump&#8217;s Triumph!&#8221; as You describes it, is also Trump&#8217;s middle finger to anyone with half a smidgeon of humanity. How he&#8217;ll &#8220;change the world&#8221; also has a rather nauseating sycophancy to it, when we have good reason to believe that his changes are going to be awful. Obviously he&#8217;s going to change the world, You magazine. Blowing up other countries with little provocation is definitely going to &#8220;change&#8221; things. I went to the trouble of reading You&#8216;s full article, which wasn&#8217;t awful. They just presented most of the facts in that flat, boring, general-interesty way they&#8217;ve been doing for more than 500 editions. In You-reading households throughout the nation it was just another week of stuff that&#8217;s happened. Trump&#8217;s Triumph? Yay! Now please pass the salt.
