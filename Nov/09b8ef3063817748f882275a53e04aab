A video has emerged on the Snakes of South Africa Facebook page, which shows a rather long, rather scary looking 2-metre snake, being removed from a toilet. According to the post, the snake was found in a block of flats in Lynnwood Glen, Pretoria, near the Struben Dam, City Buzz reported. While it is still unclear when the snake was discovered, the post indicates that the snake got away and back into the system . . This after a two-year-old female alligator that originally hails from Florida, in the United States, was seen in Brakpan, East Rand. Van Rensburg, who is an accredited snakehandler and owner of Paradise Pets and Reptiles in Dalview, acquired the alligator about a year ago. &#8211; Caxton News Service
