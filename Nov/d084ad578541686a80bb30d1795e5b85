Business rights watchdog AfriBusiness and civil rights organisation AfriForum will not only seek an interdict to stop the EFF and its leader Julius Malema from inciting people to illegally occupy land, but are also considering laying further criminal charges against Malema. The organisations on Tuesday filed an urgent application in the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria. The organisation&#8217;s Gauteng North coordinator Tarien Cooks said if the application was granted, it would mean that Malema could be charged and even incarcerated for contempt of court if he transgressed again. Malema has appeared in both the Newcastle and Bloemfontein magistrates&#8217; courts on charges of contravening the Riotous Assemblies Act by calling on EFF members to illegally occupy land. Both trials have been postponed to next year pending the outcome of Malema&#8217;s application to have the Act declared unconstitutional and unlawful. AfriForum was the complainant in the Bloemfontein court case against Malema. A defiant Malema told supporters outside court they should not be scared of prosecution and once again encouraged them to occupy land, which he said &#8220;was taken by white people through genocide&#8221;. He said white people could not own land as they &#8220;are only visitors here&#8221;, but told supporters he was not seeking to slaughter white people &#8211; &#8220;at least not yet&#8221;. Malema accused AfriForum of apartheid tendencies and warned &#8220;Afrikaner boys&#8221; that the EFF &#8220;was coming for them&#8221;.

She referred to numerous recent incidents where Malema encouraged supporters to invade land and described his threat that he might in future call for the massacre of white people as amounting to hate speech. &#8220;&#8230;Their conduct is criminal and should not be tolerated &#8230; The threat of further land invasions is very much alive and a reality. &#8220;With political tension as it is, the applicants fear that, because of the conduct of the respondents, a stage will be reached where people are going to take the law into their own hands with catastrophic results. &#8220;(Their) conduct threatens the rule of law and constitutional democracy,&#8221; she said. Cooks said their members were deeply concerned about the safety of investing in projects where land had to be bought or used to obtain loans, as financial institutions would become reluctant to give loans or use land as security, which would curtail economic growth and stability.
