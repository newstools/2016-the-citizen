Touch Central host Siyabonga Ngwekazi, popularly known as Scoop Makhathini, says he wishes South Africans were as concerned about their country&#8217;s political climate as they are about America&#8217;s. He further explained why he thinks the murders of fallen African leaders were &#8220;effective&#8221;. Taking to Twitter on Wednesday, Scoop slammed South Africans who spent the whole day tweeting and being concerned about Donald Trump&#8217;s election as America&#8217;s president, as if &#8220;a white American Hillary Clinton would have served our needs&#8221;. No matter which president America chooses, they will not solve South Africa&#8217;s problems. &#8220;Obama was black and we still suffered,&#8221; he said. Instead of talking so much about America, Scoop suggests people should clean up their own &#8220;sh*t&#8221; before taking on another country&#8217;s woes. &#8220;Nkosi sikelela/die stem is your national anthem, not the star bangled banner. You are South African. Clean your own sh*t up 1st!thanx [sic],&#8221; he said. What is most upsetting for Scoop is that South Africans are quick to unite and criticise the Americans for voting for Trump but have failed to unify on the &#8220;simplest issues involving their land&#8221;, then want to get mad at America for showing them how it&#8217;s done. &#8220;Unify on mimimum wage in your country, unify on the natural resources of your country, unify for Marikana, unify for fees and let&#8217;s see results.&#8221; Instead of looking at what other countries are doing, South Africans should focus on their own country and continent that is &#8220;bleeding to death&#8221;. We should be more concerned about our own problems as the world, the UN and &#8220;imperial powers&#8221; do not have Africa in mind.

Also, the way blacks have &#8220;neglected&#8221; their names, gods, medicine and way of life for foreign methods is also evidence that &#8220;your mind state is so foreign from yourself&#8221;. This proves why the murders of philosopher Marcus Garvey, former MK leader Chris Hani, American freedom fighter Malcolm X and other fallen African were &#8220;effective&#8221;. THIS IS HOW EFFECTIVE THE MURDERS OF MARCUS,STEVE.CHRIS AND MALCOLM WERE.AMONGST OTHER FALLEN AFRICAN PATRIOTS.YOUR MINDS ARE PROOF. &mdash; siyabonga ngwekazi (@scoopmakhathini) November 9, 2016 His followers, however, slammed him, saying he was wrong for thinking American politics did not affect Africans. Some advised him to keep quiet as he was showing his &#8220;stupidity&#8221; and lack of understanding of international relations. Scoop hit back, saying it was his followers who did not understand what he was saying to them. &#8220;I merely spoke about the passion and the urgency to cry for another country while yours is bleeding,&#8221; he said. In fact, what was worrying was that South Africans let the president they voted for &#8220;run rampid [sic]&#8221; in their country but were quick to reprimand another country for what they chose. &#8220;Discussing politics is one thing&#8230;seeing results is another. Ya&#8217;ll love to discuss but hate doing. Never wanna get the hands dirty.&#8221;
