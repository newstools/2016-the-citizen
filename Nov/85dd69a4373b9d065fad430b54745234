In an unprecedented and certainly a South African first, the much-lauded Afro soul artist Simphiwe Dana will stage a symphonic experience on November 26 at the Theatre on the Track in Kyalami. This concert will feature two internationally acclaimed artistes with roots in Africa; the melodically gracious Asa (Nigeria) and the imperiously vocal Concha Buika (Equitorial Guinea), who will add a wholesome sound to this auditory treat. South Africa has gone through a lot of changes coloured with different emotions and experiences in the past three decades. It has been a period of going through different phases of awareness, some of them sometimes overlapping. &#8220;The music industry as well has undergone similar transitions, from bubblegum in the 1980s to kwaito of the 1990s, and now the difficult transition to a more sophisticated sound, what some choose to call Afro jazz or Afro soul, Dana said We have seen an explosion of this new sound brought about by the young people of this decade, which has brought a lot of attention from the international world. The distinct African identity and sophistication with which these young people have carried this legacy hopefully makes the mothers and fathers of South African jazz proud. I strongly believe that this is the kind of music that authenticates us, because pop exists in all communities of the world; however, it is usually this more sophisticated music that informs it, maps out and defines the sounds of the future also. Basically, it is a cultural legacy we need to promote and preserve, Dana further explained. Presented by MIAGI, the Simphiwe Dana Symphony Experience, in partnership with BET and Kaya FM, will see Africans from all parts of the continent and the diaspora coming together in solidarity of vision for the African. A 60-piece orchestra, a 30-piece choir and a dance troupe will add an audiovisual spectacle to this experience.
