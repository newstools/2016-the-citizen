Dar es Salaam. The national soccer team, Taifa Stars, suffered a 3-0 hiding at the hands of Zimbabwe in a friendly match played in Harare yesterday.Stars lethargic performance was emblematic of dull preparations the team had before departing for the Zimbabwean capital.Charles Mkwasa had a day only to host a training session in Dar es Salaam because majority of the players were tied to their clubs for Vodacom Premier League matches.The defeat is big blow for Taifa Stars ahead of the Fifa world rankings, which would come out on November 24. Zimbabwe kicked off the match brightly and dominated the early stages.Their pressing, which forced Stars to employ a more defensive approach, paid off in the ninth minute when Musona Knowledge put the Warriors in the lead.Knowledge capitalised on the ball that was headed down nicely by Nyasha Mushekwi to break the deadlock.Stars defender Erasto Nyoni, who returned to action recently after a lengthy layoff, jumped for the aerial ball, but could not beat Mushekwi.After going down, Stars looked sharp pouring forward and should have levelled the score in the 12th minute, but Elias Maguri s header was bravely cleared by the Warriors shot-stopper, Mukuruva Tatenda.Tanzania went close to equalising midway through the first half, but its strikers fluffed some decent opportunities.Zimbabwe retook control of the game in the final 15 minutes of the first half, forcing Stars forward to drop into the midfield.The home side might have conceded in the 40th minute had it not been for the brilliance of their goalkeeper who reacted well to keep out Samata point-blank shot from inside the box.Stars appeared to be coping well with some growing Zimbabwe pressure, but they paid the price for lack of concentration in the second half.The all-important second goal for the Zimbabweans arrived in the 54rd minute and it was no more than the hosts deserved, as Mathew Rusike reacted quickest to a lost ball in an exciting one-two exchange of passing before producing a standout bullet shot from outside the box beyond the reach of the keeper.The Warriors were able to add some icing to the cake, as Nyasha Mushekwi added a late effort this time with Musona providing the assist with a delightful cross.With 20 minutes left, Mkwasa called off Simon Msuva for TP Mazembe forward Thomas Ulimwengu before introducing Mohammed Ibrahim in place of Tassin Mzamiru.Three minutes later, the coach introduced John Bocco to replace Maguri.Despite the substitutions, Zimbabwe still looked dominant and threatened to score more goals as time ticked away.Zimbabwe head coach Callisto Pasuwa made a number of changes as the match came into the final stages.Tinotende Kadewere came in for Musona. Mahachi came out of Cuthbert Malajila,Onismor Bhasera made way for Bruce Kangwa, Hardlife Zvirkewi was replaced by Oscar Machapa.
