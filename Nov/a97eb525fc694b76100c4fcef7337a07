Dodoma. Dodoma Regional Traffic Officer Marison Mwakyoma has commended Serengeti Breweries Limited for spearheading a campaign against irresponsible drinking in the region.Last week, the brewer launched the campaign, dubbed, Don t Drink and drive in the region with a view to sensitising the public on the dangers of driving while drunk, its social ramifications and how to alleviate it. We all know alcoholism is directly linked to reckless driving which in most cases leads to serious road accidents which have serious impacts on society. The impacts not only affect consumers but also endanger the lives of other people, Mr Mwakyoma said.
