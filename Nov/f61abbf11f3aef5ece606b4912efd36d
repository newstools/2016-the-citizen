Young Africans may see their African Champions League slot forfeited if they fail to comply with Fifa s club licensing conditions by the end of this month.Yanga and Azam will represent the Mainland at the African Champions League and Confederation Cup respectively.However, they may be ineligible for the continent s biggest club showpieces should they fail to meet the conditions.Fifa s club licensing system is based on five key criteria: sporting, personnel and administrative, financial, infrastructure and legal.According to Fifa and Caf, clubs need to meet principles in five key areas where they must have youth development programmes, comfortable stadiums for fans and training facilities.Other principles include adherence to international statutes, ownership must be transparent and fair, and they must have qualified coaches and medical staff, and professional, well-educated management.Azam are the only side that can meet all conditions even as the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) has yet to sanction them.Yanga, one of the clubs with a rich pedigree in the country, neither has a stadium nor training facility, thus risking forfeiture of their Champions League place.Speaking with The Citizen yesterday, TFF information officer Alfred Lucas stressed that clubs with continental ambitions should comply with the Fifa conditions by the end of November. It is compulsory for all clubs to meet the conditions before we can sanction them for international competitions. They have until the end of this month, said the spokesman.

Caf states that all clubs participating in next year s continental tournaments have until the end of this month to comply, failure to which they risk forfeiting their slots in its the tournaments it organises.
