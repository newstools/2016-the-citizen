Tima Reece has finally returned to the mainstream music industry after a nine-year break from the lights, camera and action. This talented Joburg-born musician, who struck gold more than a decade ago with her Crazy Bout You chart-topper, said the audience would love her new, refined and mature sound. That s because Reece and her team had recently been slaving away in the music studio, fine-tuning an album she is undoubtedly proud of . Titled 9, the nine-track album is a fusion of R&amp;B, soul, pop and trap. It explores relationship dynamics such as love, loss and the resurrection of hope. And despite being out of sight, Reece was never out of mind. She flew under the radar, while developing her talent. With her growing prowess came a demand for her services. This resulted in her being a sought-after vocalist and vocal coach, working on big local projects such as Idols SA and The Voice SA, while also discovering the TV producer in her. As for her shunning the limelight for nine years, Reece said the experience was too much for her back then. Being new to the game, the demands and disappointments of the music industry were draining, Reece said. This led to my battle with depression. She said taking a step back and performing in shows and corporate events led to her self-discovery. Reece exploded onto the local music scene at a young age, having been discovered at 15 in the TV show Shell Road to Fame. Her first hit single, Crazy Bout You, was released when she was 16, and earned her a South African Music Award Best Dance Single nomination in 2001. My desire to create music has always been a huge part of who I am. I ve been writing songs since the age of 11, and I have a whole lot more to say now at the age of 33, Reece said. I ve been through a lot over the last nine years, it s time to pour it out and into what I know best: music. Her new album will be released next week, while the first single will drop on December 2.
