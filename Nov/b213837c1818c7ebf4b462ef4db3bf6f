Mtwara. The CUF secretary-general Maalim Seif Sharif Hamad travels to Mtwara Region today.The tour comes only three days after the party regional leadership had declared not to work with any top leader embroiled in leadership wrangles.Mr Hamad is also expected to visit Lindi Region to strengthen the party.The CUF acting director for information, publicity and public relations Mbaralah Maharagande said Maalim Seif would be accompanied by some top party leaders, including national interim committee chairman Julius Mtatiro, directors, members of the national governing council and some MPs. Our mission is to inspect party activities in Mtwara and Lindi regions, gather views from members and regional leaders on how to strengthen CUF, he said. However, the Mtwara CUF leadership had declared three days ago that it was not ready to entertain any of the squabbling party camps until the party conflict was amicably resolved.Mtwara District CUF secretary Said Kulaga told reporters that they would not cooperate with any of the two wrangling parties. We do not support any of the two factions. We will not recognise or participate in any activity, including the visit of Prof Lipumba or Maalim Seif, he stressed. Prof Lipumba visited Mtwara Region several weeks ago and used the visit to sack leaders who were not loyal to him.
