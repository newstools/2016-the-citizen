Police have confirmed a member of President Jacob Zuma s protection unit was involved in an accident in which a pedestrian was killed. In a statement, Brigadier Mashadi Selepe said a police-owned vehicle hit 59-year-old Solly Motlauna in the east of Pretoria on Friday morning and he later succumbed to his injuries. The driver of the police vehicle, a member of the presidential protection unit, was on duty at the time of the accident. A docket for culpable homicide has been opened and the driver will provide his full cooperation.&#8221; The admission follows claims made in a message tweeted by Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba on Saturday. The tweet reads: I have just received the terrible news that President Zuma s blue lights brigades killed a friend, Solly Moutlana, yesterday.

She said the car was not part of a convoy at the time of the accident and there was no dignitary present in the vehicle or being transported in a convoy.

Mashaba said he visited the Motlauna family on Sunday, but questioned the accident and said a statement on the matter by police was long overdue. This accident happened on Friday in broad daylight; there should be a case being investigated by now. Mashaba said he was not saying the president was in the vehicle when the accident occurred, but questioned the speed at which the vehicle was travelling. &#8211; Caxton News Service
