The ANC Youth League and Women&#8217;s League seem to have it all wrong with the concept of death. The Women&#8217;s League recently fell for a hoax statement saying Archbishop Desmond Tutu had died and went on to release a statement of their own, sending condolences to the emeritus archbishop&#8217;s family. It was even more embarrassing when they had to release another statement of apology for the first statement. Before this, there was a video circulating on social media of the league&#8217;s march against Oscar Pistorius, calling for him to be sentenced. Nothing wrong with that, only they were heard saying &#8220;Steenkamp must rot in jail&#8221;, words that left people rather perplexed. Now, ANCYL Western Cape has even shocked the EFF&#8217;s Mbuyiseni Ndlozi after a poster allegedly from them advertising a memorial lecture on President Jacob Zuma. http://twitter.com/MbuyiseniNdlozi/status/801801267647565824 The poster left many laughing, while some say it is just embarrassing. What makes the poster funnier is the keynote speaker Kebby Maphatsoe, who has been out of the spotlight after a picture of him naked was leaked on social media. The youth league in the province has denied any knowledge of the lecture. It further clarified any confusion that the poster may have caused regarding whether the president was still alive. &#8220;We have no knowledge of such an event organised by the ANCYL Western Cape. The ANCYL would like to inform young people of the province that President Zuma is very much alive and present.&#8221; The youth league further says Maphatsoe is also not aware of the event. &#8220;The office of Comrade Kebby Maphatsoe has informed us that Comrade Kebby is not aware nor has he been invited to such an event.
