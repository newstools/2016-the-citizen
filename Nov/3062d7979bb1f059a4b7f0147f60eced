The Democratic Alliance (DA) walked out of a joint sitting of parliament in the National Assembly on Tuesday after one of their MPs was ordered to withdraw a comment about President Jacob Zuma being JZ 783 .

African National Congress (ANC) MPs took exception to the DA s Denise Robinson statement, saying her remarks were derogatory. Speaker Baleka Mbete refused to listen to DA chief whip John Steenhuisen s point of order after she had asked Robinson to withdraw her statement or she would have to leave the podium, eventually leading the party walking out of the house. Last month, the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) told Zuma s legal team it wanted oral arguments to be made in an open court before granting his appeal of a high court s decision that the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) should reinstate corruption charges against him. Earlier this year, a full bench of the North Gauteng High Court found that the NPA s decision to drop charges was irrational and should be set aside. In his parting short before leaving the house, Steenhuisen said the decision to drop the charges was wrong, and the DA would challenge it in the SCA. Zuma is expected to appear in the National Assembly on Wednesday for his last oral question and answer session with MPs for the year. ALSO READ: Please keep Zuma, we need him Mpofu
