He has risen quite fast, but I am unfazed by his record. I am ready to give him a boxing lesson. I will go to India and knock him out before his fans, bragged Cheka. I have heard a lot about this Indian boxer and there s a lot of hype around him, I just can t wait to be the one to put him in his place. Cheka added: If you go through my record, you will find that I managed 17 knockouts, I have boxed way more rounds than he has, so I don t see how he will walk out of the ring unscathed. I have watched his previous fights; he has fought absolutely nobody so far. The day he will meet me in the ring, he won t have a reply for anything I throw at him. Cheka s trainer Abdallah Lilamba said he was impressed with his boxer s progress in training, hoping that he will record a convincing win in New Delhi.Singh s Manchester-based trainer Lee Beard has called his fighter an extremely quick learner , and the former Olympic bronze medalist is confident his expanding range of skills will prove enough to keep his WBO Asia Pacific title.
