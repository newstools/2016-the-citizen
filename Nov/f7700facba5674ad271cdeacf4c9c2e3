A Road Traffic Inspectorate (RTI) officer and a driving school owner have been granted bail after they were arrested for selling learners licences in KwaZulu-Natal. The Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) members received information about illicit dealings and launched an undercover operation in Mooi River, Estcourt News reported. The RTI officer from Mooi River, Sikhumbuzo Ndlovu, 34, and driving school owner Zandile Dlamini, 47, were arrested last Friday. They appeared in the Durban Specialised Commercial Crime Court on Monday, and they were both granted R3 800 bail, said Hawks spokesperson Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo. The case has been postponed to January 30, 2017. &#8211; Caxton News Service
