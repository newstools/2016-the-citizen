However, it was not immediately clear if he appeared in court for allegedly driving at 187km/h in a 120km/h zone in the Parys area ahead of Malema&#8217;s court appearance in Bloemfontein for inciting illegal land occupations by his supporters. Ramotsoto told the news website traffic officers had to follow the vehicle for more than 100km, until they reached Ventersburg, because the driver allegedly would not stop. He was arrested in Ventersburg in accordance with road traffic law, which meant an automatic arrest for driving beyond the set speed limit. The EFF commander-in-chief apparently then took the wheel and drove himself the rest of the way to make it to court on time. The driver&#8217;s name and his court date haven t been revealed by provincial authorities. ALSO READ: Coffin assault men to appear in court
