The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) on Wednesday accused Lonmin of paying monthly salary payments to a former employee when he was awaiting a murder trial, saying that it was shocked and saddened by this. This week, the Mogwase Magistrate s Court in the North West sentenced Bavuyise Kwaziwa to a double life imprisonment for killing former NUM shop stewards Nobongile Norah Madolo and Percy Letanang in Nkaneng, near Marikana in 2013. Kwaziwa, who was allegedly a member of the rival union Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu), gunned down Madola in August 2013 while she was walking back to her home holding a live chicken. NUM Rustenburg regional secretary, Desmond Mfuloane, said the union had concrete evidence that Lonmin had been paying monthly salaries to Kwaziwa while he was awaiting trial. It is ironic that what happened at Impala Platinum is actually a repeat at Lonmin. Implala did the same in 2014. Lonmin is repeating the same thing of paying a convicted murderer while he was in jail, Mfuloane said. It is clear that there is an agenda by companies to wage a war against the NUM. Lonmin spokeswoman Sue Vey failed to respond to requests for comments after numerous attempts to reach her. Amcu declined to comment. The NUM further accused Lonmin of transferring its membership overnight to Amcu without verification, saying that it was considering to pursue a civil claim for compensation. African News Agency
