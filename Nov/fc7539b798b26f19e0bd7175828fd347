The enormity of dismantling the Australian cricket team is certain to have lasting consequences which outweigh the almost dismissive innings and 80-run victory the Proteas scored over their opponents in the second Test in Hobart. The most obvious of these will doubtless manifest itself in a hasty wholesale reshuffle of the Australian side and might just spell the end of the tenure of Steve Smith as captain and a rethink about what Darren Lehmann brings to the side as a coach after five successive defeats at Test level. It is the type of slump which has ended more storied careers than those of Smith or Lehmann. Smith openly admitted to being embarrassed sitting here at the post-match media conference. In retrospect, two things are self-evident; first Smith s downcast, demoralised demeanour was fully justified in the abject capitulation of the side he led in the Tasmanian capital. The other is the opportunity which has presented itself for South Africa to clinch an unprecedented series whitewash over Australia to add to the 5-0 clean sweep in the one-day series in South Africa which preceded the Test tour Down Under, when the teams meet again in a day-night clincher at Adelaide in eight days time. Certainly, stand-in skipper Faf du Plessis he stepped in for injured regular captain AB de Villiers is keen to go for the strangle and watch the Aussies squirm in the knowledge that, even without Dale Steyn, he has a fearsome pace attack and the gap left by De Villiers can be filled with a batting line-up capable of overcoming early adversity. It is also of more than passing interest that even if the Adelaide Test is inconclusive, the Proteas have already earned themselves the adrenaline boost to surge back to regaining the ceremonial sceptre which denotes the world s top Test team.
