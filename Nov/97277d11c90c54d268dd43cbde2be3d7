South African Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa hosted his Chinese counterpart, Vice President Li Yuanchao, in Cape Town on Tuesday as part of the 6th South Africa-China Bi-National Commission (BNC). Ramaphosa said the two countries, which form part of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) bloc, had strengthened their relationship and had committed to agreements totalling around R94 billion. This session identifies where we need to improve for further action, said Ramaphosa. There will surely be concrete benefits for both countries and its people, said Li Yuanchao. &#8211; African News Agency
