Today is payday for many, but also Black Friday. The malls are packed with customers trying to buy items at reduced prices, while some shops have implemented a customer-in-customer-out system to monitor the number of people inside.

We have no idea how much they were going for, but from the video, you can tell it&#8217;s next to nothing. Watch the video below: #BlackFriday Chaos over toilet paper.
