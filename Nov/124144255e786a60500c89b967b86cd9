It is one of those inescapably cruel twists in the human condition that unemployment more often than not raises a mailed fist to strike the most vulnerable. The frailties inherent in the current South African job market continue to frustrate attempts to reignite the spluttering fires of an economy under siege at virtually every angle. But for the undereducated and semiskilled workers trying desperately to hold themselves clear of the savage spectre of starvation, the situation could not be more fraught. The Quarterly Labour Force Survey released by Stats SA indicates that over the period covered by the report, 15 000 domestic workers lost their jobs in private households, a figure which equates to 5 000 people a month being forced into the ranks of the jobless. This must surely qualify as a crisis of huge proportions in a sector which has historically proved to be defenceless against the capricious whims of the employers. It is all very well for these employers to argue that they often feed, house and in some cases help educate their employee s children. But it should also be taken into account that if the job disappears from those fortunate to be accorded these benefits, so does the home, the meals and the future, a situation which could catapult even more youth into the growing pool of the unskilled forced through circumstance into the demeaning and often unsuccessful search for work in a shrinking market. It is blatantly obvious this cycle of misery is both unacceptable and unsustainable, but it is equally unreasonable to place the blame on the employers, whose own families must perforce come first. There is no ready answer. But leaving some of the most exposed of our fellow citizens open to the fickleness of financial flux cannot be construed as showing even a shadow of common humanity.
