Former Idols SA judge and Cliff Central founder Gareth Cliff has slammed a &#8220;sensational&#8221; and &#8220;misleading&#8221; headline that said he had admitted to giving his former colleague Mara Louw a &#8220;spiked&#8221; drink. Cliff trended on Twitter on the weekend after the Sunday Times reported Cliff admitted in his book that he gave Louw the drink that led to her much-publicised behaviour on the show. As a result, her contract was never renewed. Watch the video posted on YouTube by redcementroom below: Cliff said the reporting was &#8220;fallacious&#8221; and that the matter was &#8220;in the hands of my legal team&#8221;, further urging fans to read the &#8220;actual&#8221; story of what exactly happened in his new book. This year&#8217;s season was the last for Cliff, who resigned from the show earlier this month. We can confirm Mr Gareth Cliff s resignation as a judge on Idols SA. We are grateful for his contribution to the show over the last 11 seasons, and we wish him well with his future endeavors, Idols SA said in a statement. Fans did not take the news well, with one Benedick Brand saying: Sounds a lot like a deal was striked during the court case. Sounds like the case was settled with M-Net allowing him to finish this year on condition that he resigns at the end of the show. Cliff is no racist, that much we all know. Sad day. Another said they wished it was Somizi resigning and not Cliff: I wish it was Somizi resigning He just overdoes everything and he is starting to annoy me rather than entertain because of his attention seeking tendencies Anyway Gareth, you were a cool judge and idols will never be the same without you You will be missed. Cliff was temporarily axed from the show earlier this year after his comments about KwaZulu-Natal estate agent Penny Sparrow, who compared black Durban beachgoers to monkeys. Cliff had said her comments constituted free speech. Read more: Gareth Cliff resigns from Idols SA
