The Executive Mayor of Ekurhuleni Mzwandile Masina says the attack on President Jacob Zuma is unwarranted. Addressing reporters at the Chris Hani heritage site in Dawn Park, East Rand, Masina said, &#8220;In our own assessment in political meetings, we have come to a conclusion that the call for economic transfer, and the issue of land are agitating monopoly capital to the point that they are using some of the platforms like the media to turn our people against us. &#8220;If they have an alternative to democracy, and the things we want to achieve over the coming years, let them tell the people of South Africa so that the debate must be about ideas, it must not be about personal discard.&#8221; ALSO READ: Report linking Mbeki to Hani assassination offends Hani s widow He added that the attack on President Zuma is unwarranted and believes that it is also an attack on the African National Congress, which &#8220;has brought freedom&#8221; to South Africans. &#8220;The policies of the ANC have not shifted, we promised democracy, and over 20 years into democracy we have matured and now we want to move ahead to make sure that we liberate our people economically and at the centre of it is the issue of the land. Once we start raising those things, we are now being turned against our people to become the enemy of the same revolution that we waged.&#8221; Masina said there is a very strong voice from company CEOs, NGOs, religious organisations regarding the current political tension in the country. &#8220;We are not saying people must not speak. But the call should be about where do we take South Africa and it must not be about regime change, because we are a democratic State. When the ANC fought against apartheid, the alternative was for democracy. Now those who want democracy to fall, they must tell us what are they presenting to the people of South Africa.&#8221; He said they want to engage with the CEOs, NGOs, churches and all those who have standing views about the current political situation, &#8220;but all parties should be clear about programs in place&#8221;.
