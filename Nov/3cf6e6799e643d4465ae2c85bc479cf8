After 11 years my number changing. I&#39;m now 083 customer &mdash; Tbo Touch (@iamtbotouch) November 18, 2016 Tbo Touch started a #DataMustFall campaign, calling for network service providers to cut data costs, as they were &#8220;too expensive&#8221;. Taking to Twitter, Tbo Touch listed a number of reasons he thought data should be affordable, saying South Africa was the only country in Africa that had high data costs. Tbo Touch said the success of his campaign would enable every student to access textbooks online for those who could not afford it, while some would be able to stream lectures. &#8220;Imagine watching your lecture on YouTube while downloading a textbook on Amazon.com,&#8221; he tweeted, also asking how a young entrepreneur was supposed to market their business &#8220;when the internet is the price of gold&#8221;. He said he had asked Icasa chairperson Rubben Mohlaloga to intervene, asking him why South Africa had the &#8220;most expensive broadband in the world&#8221;, also revealing he paid R9 000 for data monthly. Tbo Touch went as far as sending Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa to cut data costs if he wanted his vote and &#8220;pocket&#8221;, responding to a fan who asked him if Ramaphosa still had shares at MTN. His campaign gained support from celebrities such as D&#8217;Banj, designer David Tlale and Gauteng education MEC Panyaza Lesufi, who tweeted he was in support of the campaign.
