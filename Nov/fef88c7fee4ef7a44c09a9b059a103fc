Twitter says if South Africa were a girl group, Zuma would be the Michelle Williams of Destiny&#8217;s Child always shunned and overshadowed by other, probably better, leaders. The hashtag #PoorBaba has been trending since Wednesday morning, with tweeps digging the internet for old pictures they could cast in a new light for the purposes of the hashtag. The rules behind the hashtag are similar to those that birthed internet gem poormichelle.com, a blog that collects random and awkward photos and videos of Michelle Williams from Destiny s Child, often seen as being overshadowed by her band mates Beyonce Knowles and Kelly Rowland. The photos are captioned with words of feigned sympathy while actually making fun of her.
