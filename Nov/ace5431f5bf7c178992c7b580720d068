A 23-year-old cable thief was shot and injured at the Rooiwal Power Station on Wednesday at about midnight during a shootout between him and officers from the Tshwane Metro Police Department (TMPD). TMPD spokesperson Senior Superintendent Isaac Mahamba said officers were on duty around the station when they approached the suspect, who was caught red-handed. When the suspect noticed that the officers were coming after him, he started shooting at the officers. The offices returned fire, and the suspect was shot and injured, Mahamba said. He said the suspect was taken to hospital, where he is under police guard. A firearm was recovered from the suspect. Spades, knifes and other digging materials were also found on the scene as well as a 15-metre cable that was stolen, Mahamba added. He said metro police were working hard to combat cable theft. Offices are deployed in different trenches for visible policing to prevent this crime. He asked members of public, who might have any information regarding cable theft, to come forward and report it immediately by calling 012 358 7095/6 or report it at your nearest police station.
