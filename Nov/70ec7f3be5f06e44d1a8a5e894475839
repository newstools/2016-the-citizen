Adoption numbers at the Dolphin Coast SPCA in Durban fall dramatically over the holiday season, and many animals are in need of a loving home as we draw closer to Christmas. The SPCA s Debbie Filmalter told The Courier the SPCA welcomed an average of more than 80 dogs into its kennels every month, North Coast Courier reported. Of these dogs, only 10-15 will be adopted, a number that dwindles to only two or three over December. The SPCA not only deals with lost or rescued dogs though, they also offer vaccinations and deworming services and can help with sterilisation of pets. They are appealing to the community to visit them and adopt a furry friend, and remember, they have cats for adoption too for those among you who are not dog people. We have no funding from the government, so we are entirely dependent on the community for donations, said Filmalter. Donations can be made online, visit the SPCA s website at www.spcadbn.org.za for information on how to donate. The SPCA always needs food for cats and dogs and monetary donations also help keep them afloat. &#8211; Caxton News Service
