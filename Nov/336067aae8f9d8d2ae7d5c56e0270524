The Boks, however, have history on their side, having not lost to England since 2006, winning 11 of the last 12 Tests while the third Test of the series in 2012 in Port Elizabeth resulted in a 14-14 draw. The last time the two teams met at Twickenham was in 2014, with the Boks winning 31-28. A big equaliser could, however, be the weather, with a maximum of nine degrees predicted for London on Saturday. There is also a strong possibility of a strong wind and persistent rain. The temperatures are expected to dip to 6 degrees or even lower during the match. Kickoff is at 4.30pm. #ENGVSRSA
