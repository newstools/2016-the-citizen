Speaking at the launch of a 55 million euros ($59 million) a year shirt sponsorship deal Bartomeu told journalists he was &#8220;relaxed about Messi&#8217;s contract&#8221;. With the clock ticking and only 18 months left on Messi&#8217;s deal the club want to extend it, as they did with Neymar and as they are trying to do with Luis Suarez. &#8220;We are all convinced that he will end his playing days at the heart of this club. All the socios (stake-holding fans) believe it, it&#8217;s just a question of how we get over the line,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This player has led us to our great sporting successes in recent years and he will continue to do so, he&#8217;s far from finished.&#8221; Spanish sports daily Marca had sown doubt over the 29-year-old Messi&#8217;s future on Monday with claims the Argentine was stalling over a new deal and flirting instead with the idea of joining his former coach Pep Guardiola at Manchester City. Brazilian superstar Neymar signed a new five-year contract with Barcelona in October that will keep the 24-year-old at the Spanish champions until 2021, saying he felt &#8220;at home&#8221; at the Camp Nou. European Golden Shoe winner Luis Suarez said last week negotiations to extend his contract with Barcelona until 2021 were running smoothly.
