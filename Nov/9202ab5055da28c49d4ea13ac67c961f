It is risible that of a former 12-member board, only Obert Maghuve obdurately remains steadfastly at the SABC, battered by a host of resignations from the non-executive board of the public broadcaster. This raises farcical images of Maghuve sitting solitary in an otherwise empty boardroom, a one-man band playing to an audience long departed. And, while he might not have any dissensions during his bouts of solitaire, he will have no one to agree, or who will endorse any moves he might be contemplating. This, after President Jacob Zuma accepted the latest round of resignations from Vuyo Mhlakaza and Aaron Tshidzumba. It is clearly a situation that is contrary to even the most lightly regarded rules of corporate governance, and equally clearly one which cannot continue at the troubled broadcasting temple in Johannesburg s Auckland Park headquarters. The malaise of the SABC has been allowed to linger on too long, dragging its arrogant shuffling way through the courts, and all of this to the detriment of the corporation and, many would argue, to the viewers and listeners who rely on the service. A new board must be urgently installed, before this bizarre boardroom burlesque takes on even more ridiculous proportions.
