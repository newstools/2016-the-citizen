One of the great strengths of the ANC has been that it has always prided itself as a top-down organisation, a party which takes the opinions of the grass roots members seriously. It could also be argued that it has been the ruling party s greatest weakness, mitigating against quick decision-making as the information flows up and down the hypothetical pyramid. This leads to the inescapable thought that when things are not going as expected, the ANC sets up a defensive cordon of forums to talk about the deficiencies. Certainly, this must be the inference from secretary-general Gwede Mantashe s report back on Tuesday on the potentially explosive outcome of the internal revolt at the party s national executive committee (NEC) against retaining President Jacob Zuma as the head of state and the leader of the party. Mantashe maintained that the motion for Zuma to step down had been openly debated. He could hardly have denied that this was indeed the case after the debate on the motion brought by Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom was strongly backed and the NEC meeting due to end in Pretoria was extended late into Monday night. Hanekom s motion was the most cutting of the calls for Zuma to go, coming from the very heart of the party and following the DA s failed motion of no confidence, trade union federation Cosatu backing Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, the online Save SA Organisation launched by ANC veteran Sipho Pityana on November 23 and the EFF saying it would not back the ANC against its opponents in the House of Assembly. One voice missing was Zuma s. He is in Cuba to attend the funeral of Fidel Castro. But in short, the ANC will sit down and talk about the issue at the party s next consultative conference, which starts on June 30 next year and, Mantashe maintained, had been extended by a day to July 5, specifically to address matters of unity within the organisation.
