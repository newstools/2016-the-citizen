Dar es Salaam. Some of Tanzania s biggest foreign investors say they could scale back their operations or expansion plans because of tougher demands placed on companies, including higher tax bills, as part of the president s drive to overhaul the economy.At least six companies are rethinking their business and investment plans, according to Reuters interviews with senior executives at a dozen of the biggest foreign firms operating in Tanzania, or their local arms, in sectors including mining, telecoms and shipping.Three said they could scale back operations, two said they planned to expand in other countries on the continent instead, while one said it was in the process of withdrawing from Tanzania altogether.The companies asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter and because their plans have not been made public.One firm had not yet made a decision on how to respond to the government reforms, while five companies said their plans were unaffected - including two involved in giant projects, a $30 billion LNG plant and a $3 billion fertiliser plant.Tanzania is more reliant on foreign direct investment than many other regional countries, given the size of its economy. It received just over $1.5 billion last year, into an economy valued at under $45 billion, according to figures from the UN Conference on Trade and Investment and the World Bank.President John Magufuli promised to transform an economy hobbled by red-tape and corruption and carry out a major building programme. A strict new tax regime tops the list of companies complaints; Magufuli s government imposed tax hikes this year on mobile money transfers, banking, tourism services and cargo transit services. In some cases, businesses say they were warned by regulators not to pass the cost on to consumers.Tax revenues for the 2014/2015 financial year totalled 9.8 trillion shillings ($4.5 billion). In 2016/2017, the target is 15.1 trillion - a jump of more than 50 per cent.Many of the executives interviewed by Reuters said they were frustrated by increased tax demands that they say do not properly correspond to their incomes.An executive whose company has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the country said he was now looking at expanding in Kenya or Mali, rather than Tanzania, partly due to the new tax demands.The government says teething problems with new measures will give way to a fairer, stronger economy, and says it is natural for businesses to feel unsettled during periods of change. There have been some complaints but we hear them and we have an open door, said Adolf Mkenda, permanent secretary at the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment.Richard Kayombo, director of the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA), said increased tax income was needed to pay for new infrastructure in the country.The TRA won nine out of 10 recent tax cases in court, which showed their bills were fair, he added.
