Gerrard, 36, announced earlier this week that he will leave the LA Galaxy in December after 18 months in Major League Soccer. MK Dons are currently 21st in League One and without a manager following the departure of Karl Robinson last month. The BBC, which did not cite any sources, said it was unclear if Gerrard would be offered a player-manager role. Speaking on Tuesday, Gerrard said: &#8220;Although I&#8217;m going back to England to live, it&#8217;s certainly not the end of me in football terms. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a lot of things to consider over the coming weeks and months, and I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll be back involved in the game. I&#8217;ve got options on the pitch, off the pitch.&#8221; Gerrard has also been linked with moves to Celtic and Newcastle United. He left Liverpool in 2015 after a glittering 17-year Anfield career in which he eight major trophies including the 2005 Champions League. He was also capped 114 times by England, making him his country&#8217;s fourth most-capped player.
