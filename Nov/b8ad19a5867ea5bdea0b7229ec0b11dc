Residents in the Rayton and Cullinan areas could be left high and dry if they do not start saving water immediately. City of Tshwane spokesperson Lindela Mashigo said the Rayton Water Tower level was decreasing at an alarming rate due to the high water usage by consumers within Rayton and surrounds. Mashigo said if consumers continued with the high water usage, the water tower would unfortunately run dry. Customers should note that the outgoing supply will be minimised in order to allow the water tower to build up its maximum water level capacity, Mashigo said.
