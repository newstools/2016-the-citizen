The Daily Show host and comedian Trevor Noah has answered questions most of us have been curious about in an interview with American email newsletter theSkimm on Tuesday. If you thought the comedian was a morning person, you were wrong. Noah says he normally wakes up between 7.30am and the first police siren of the day. Though he sometimes sets his alarm for 5am, he snoozes for 2 hours. &#8220;I&#8217;m addicted to snooze,&#8221; he says. Does he snore? Nope, he doesn&#8217;t, &#8220;luckily&#8221;. Three things he cannot live without in the morning are his toothbrush, phone and a shower. He does not really have a pre-Daily Show ritual. &#8220;The ritual is working on the show. It&#8217;s a nonstop roller coaster.&#8221; With him being a South African and having spent some time in America, he was asked to explain the biggest difference between South Africans and Americans. Noah: &#8220;South Africans are blunt, and Americans love to beat around the bush. South Africans will tell you when you have something stuck in your teeth. Americans will leave you to walk around looking like you French-kissed a hedge.&#8221; Also read: What Trevor Noah is like when he&#8217;s in love Perhaps a perfect example would be EFF leader Julius Malema, who never holds back from saying what he thinks. He has previously, in parliament, slammed President Jacob Zuma for impregnating &#8220;his friend&#8217;s daughter&#8221; and &#8220;sleeping with an HIV-positive woman and saying he took a shower after that&#8221;. So Noah could be right. He was further asked what his slogan would be if he were a candidate for president. &#8220;The system&#8217;s already a joke why not make it official?&#8221; he said, further saying a panda bear would be his spirit animal if he were to start a political campaign. When everyone on social media posts a picture of themselves with the caption, &#8220;woke up like this&#8221;, Noah said his caption would be, &#8220;woke up flawed but with every intention of concealing all imperfections&#8221;.
