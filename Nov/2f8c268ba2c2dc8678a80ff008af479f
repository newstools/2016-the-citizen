Eight men who allegedly kidnapped three women, tied them up and tortured them in an abandoned house in Cresta were charged with kidnapping, assault and being in possession of an unlicensed firearm, reports the Randburg Sun. Gauteng police spokesperson, Captain Kay Makhubela confirmed the men were expected to appear at the Roodepoort Magistrates&#8217; Court soon. The women, who were freed by police at around 6pm on Tuesday, were found with burn wounds. Makhubela said the three women were the victims of a black dollar scam in which they were told by a man at a shopping centre that if they gave him money, he would return it back several fold. Makhubela warned that people should refrain from trying to get rich overnight as it runs the risk of being deceived by people they don t know. He said this thinking often leads people to be lured into extreme danger as they can become targets. Members of the public need to be very careful, particularly when dealing with people they don t know, he said. He advised that people should work hard to earn their money, rather than falling victim to these scams. People end up losing their hard-earned money by trusting people they don t know. People should know that they need to work hard to earn money instead of going around believing that they can quickly get rich. Caxton News Service
