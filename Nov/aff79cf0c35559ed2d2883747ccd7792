Songosongo. The fish business on the island in Kilwa District, Lindi Region has transformed dramatically with vendors purchasing deep freezers to preserve fish for sale.Previously fishmongers sun-dried the bulk of their catch to sell to markets in Dar es Salaam, Mtwara, Tanga and Morogoro and other regions. We used to make huge losses as the fish would spoil while still in storage and during transportation said Ms Chiku Abdallah, a fish dealer.With an opportunity to sell more fresh fish dealers have an average of four deep freezers in their homes to preserve their easily perishable merchandise.The improvement in storing fish was made possible after Songas resolved to connect over 300 households on the island to electricity supply in 2013 in a bid to curb illegal power connections.Although the storage of fish has modernised, fishermen still use traditionally made wooden canoes and sell their fish between Sh4,000 and Sh5,000 per kilogramme to middlemen during the peak season.More fishermen would like Kilwa Masoko District Council on the island to put up a modern a fish market at Kilwa Kivinje to attract buyers from all over the country who would deal with the fishermen directly doing away with agents. We only make an average profit of Sh2,000 per kilogramme that is reduced by operational costs including transportation, said Ms Darini Magoma, a fish agent who claims the fish business is not that lucrative.She says, to make matters worse, the wholesalers especially those from Dar es Salaam insist on paying in bits and pieces.She added that the fishermen need modern fishing boats to allow them to venture into deeper waters as illegal fishing has depleted the fish in shallow waters. Currently we fish dealers have to wait at least two and half weeks to purchase at least 350 kilogrammes of fish. Illegal fishing gear including explosives have led to less fish in the waters, she said.Chairman of the village security committee Darasa Mwamba said Nyuni and Fanjovu sub islands are notorious hideouts for fishermen who use illegal gear prompting the village to form the Beach Management Unit that patrols the coastline.He said the unit is faced with technological challenges as the rogue fishermen possess sophisticated firearms. The Tanzania People s Defence Forces should be deployed here as records show that their presence reduces illegal fishing activities, said Mr Mwamba. The chairman said the islanders would like to embark on setting up fish ponds as a long term measure to replenish fish.With more accessing electricity supply villagers have opened a number of shops, guest houses, bars, barber shops and hair salons as they take advantage of the electricity supply.Residents argue that with a modern market the transport infrastructure would have to improve and suggest that berths are constructed at Kilwa Kivinje. The improved infrastructure would attract more players in the fish business, as well tourists looking for adventure, said Ms Aisha Mwinyi another fish dealer. She said while Songo Songo had a jetty airport for investors and government executives, islanders rely on marine transport which is not developed to support the new developments.
