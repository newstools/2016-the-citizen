Strain and rinse. Place in a food processor with the rest of the ingredients and blitz until smooth. Spoon the pudding into serving glasses and refrigerate, at least 20 minutes or overnight. 2 For the salsa, combine all of the ingredients and set aside, 10 minutes. 3 To serve, top each pudding with a spoonful of pineapple salsa and coconut chunks, garnished with fresh mint leaves and a sprinkling of cocoa powder.
