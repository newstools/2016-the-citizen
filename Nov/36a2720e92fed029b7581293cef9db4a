Sunday newspaper City Press has reported that &#8220;banking woes&#8221; are behind the fact that the glitzy ANN7 South African of the Year Awards won&#8217;t be taking place this year. None of the country&#8217;s big four banks want to do business with the Gupta family any more, and India&#8217;s Bank of Baroda, which has been assisting Gupta companies, has now come under greater scrutiny, according to the paper. It apparently did not release the funds to pay for the awards show, and so headline act Jennifer Lopez won&#8217;t be coming to South Africa after all. The Economic Freedom Fighters had earlier made a plea to local artists to also not support the event, which had been scheduled to take place on November 25, but was &#8220;postponed&#8221; on Tuesday. Industry experts told the paper the Guptas may have lost anywhere between R5 million and R14 million if they already paid the US singer a deposit or her full fee, which may have been non-refundable.
