A 51-year-old man from Constantia has been arrested in the Cape Town CBD after he was found in possession of 12 uncut diamonds, Western Cape police said on Thursday. Police spokesperson Captain FC Van Wyk said that at about 2:30pm on Wednesday, police were on routine crime prevention in the city centre when they spotted a black BMW 750 series without valid registration plates. Members stopped the vehicle at the corner of Adderley and Strand streets, and upon inquiry pertaining to the registration, the driver could not produce any, Van Wyk said. During a preliminary investigation, the driver of the vehicle got out and took something out of his pocket and attempted to hand it over to his friend. Vigilant police officers noticed the attempted exchange and confiscated the plastic packet. They opened the package and noticed that there were 12 uncut diamonds wrapped inside. The driver could not account for the possession of the diamonds and was subsequently arrested for being in possession of uncut diamonds. Police said the man from Constantia would appear in the Cape Town Magistrates Court on Friday.
