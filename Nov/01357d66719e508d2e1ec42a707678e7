My first job after leaving the university was in the hotel industry, where I was recruited as a graduate trainee. I was na ve and my interaction with the personnel manager was during interview and orientation.Rarely did I interact with personnel department until after my posting to join the department after six months of working in all the other departments.For the younger generation, those days HR was referred to as personnel department and the change of name came only towards 2000, although some companies adopted earlier.Personnel department was more concerned with ensuring that employees followed rules and regulations and was hence loved and hated in equal measure.Since, the profession has evolved and now HR departments are friendlier and people-oriented. However, it may not be possible for HR to answer all the questions in the minds of the fresh graduates or young professionals aspiring to move up in careers or business.The Citizen newspaper has identified this gap and this column is intended to bridge that.
