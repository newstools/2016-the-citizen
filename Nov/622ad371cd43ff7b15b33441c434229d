Dar es Salaam. The government has been urged to establish an Education Regulatory Authority that would oversee all learning aspects in the country.By so doing, it will address problems associated with frequent curriculum changes that undermine the country s education system, according to the education sector watchdog, HakiElimu.This, the organisation says, will also give education stakeholders an opportunity to conduct researches before its implementation.Speaking to reporters yesterday, HakiElimu executive director John Kalage said minister for Education, Science and Technology has been given huge mandate of changing educational documents, a situation that may impact negatively on education standard.Mr Kalage said, earlier this month, the education ministry issued document No. 5 of 2016 which has brought several changes in teachers training programmes.Under the new document, all aspects of teachers colleges ranging from certificate to diploma level will now be under the ministry under supervision of the National Examination Council Tanzania (Necta). These changes are not bad. In fact, we are happy because the government has responded to our comments, but such changes may not be effectively implemented if there is no proper organ to oversee them, said Mr Kalage.He said frequent changes in the education system implies that there are no sustainable programmes, and that the government may not succeed to address the alarming fall in the quality of education. We should have a vision of education instead of basing upon the wishes of one person because every appointed minister tends to implement programmes of his or her choice, he said. At the end of the day, lives of millions of young people are affected, he added.He disclosed that they have urged the education ministry to do research before embarking on changing its programmes.He said, through research, experts can conduct trials on the changes as a way of helping them to identify weaknesses and strengths ahead of programme implementation.
