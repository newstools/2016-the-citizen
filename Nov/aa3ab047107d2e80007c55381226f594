A container at the Bremmer Street squatter camp in the west of Pretoria caught fire on Wednesday. The fire broke out in Claremont at about 12.30pm, but it was extinguished by 1.40pm, Rekord Moot reported. No injuries were reported. Tshwane Emergency services spokesperson Johan Pieterse said the cause of the fire was unknown. We do not know what exactly caused the fire, as it was an open flame. It could be anything, and the residents do not have any access to electricity. Tshwane metro police, the SAPS and the Tshwane emergency services were on the scene and are still investigating. &#8211; Caxton News Service
