Madonsela is the subject of an investigation by Mkhwebane&#8217;s office, after she revealed she had given eNCA an audio recording of an interview she had with Zuma while compiling her state capture investigation. Madonsela sought to prove she had indeed given Zuma an opportunity to respond to 42 questions she had posed to him. Zuma later denied Madonsela had given him enough time to respond, questioning her intention in compiling and publishing the report without his input. According to City Press, Madonsela remains unapologetic about her move, instead warning Mkhwebane to protect the public and not Zuma.

For her own sake, she mustn&#8217;t be put in a position where she is seen as the president&#8217;s protector. She has a job to do and I think her job is to protect people. The presidency and particulalry the president should not make it appear she is there to protect the president,&#8221; said Madonsela. Madonsela, who is set to take up a position with Stellenbosch University in 2018, added she was within her rights to release the recording so the public could decide for themselves regarding Zuma&#8217;s claims. Zuma issued a statement on Friday effectively telling Madonsela to back off. &#8220;This conduct has serious implications with regards to ethics, confidentiality and the protection of information gathered during investigations by the office of the public protector,&#8221; the president stated.
