Dar es Salaam. Incumbent Tanzania Olympic Committee (TOC) secretary general, Filbert Bayi, has declared his intention to defend his post in the December 10 general election.Bayi, who won one of the two only Olympic silver medals for the country, said yesterday that he wants to continue contributing in the development of sports. I was silent all this time expecting that many would come forward and pick the forms for the sake of replacing me, but unfortunately, they have only focussed on other positions. I have, therefore, decided to defend my post come December 10, said Bayi.The elections will be held in Dodoma and the silver medallist disclosed that the deadline for picking forms will be today.Bayi is so far the sole candidate eying the post, which means he is certain to return to the post he has already held for the past 12 years.Should members vote him to the post, he will be assured of serving the TOC for 16 years. I believe the next four years will be glorious considering the foundation that has been laid, said Bayi. I am not a finished product yet and as a sports administrator, I still have the ability to contribute in changing the fortunes of our nation. I have a sports institution that promises a bright future for the country; it has 250 workers and more than 100 students, so I am really looking forward to a glorious tenure. He stressed that he has been part of the running sports programmes and harboured hopes that Tanzania would be one of the countries to beat in the next few years. I have contributed immensely in many sports programmes that are already vibrant. I hope that they will produce the best athletes who will do the country proud sooner rather than later, the 1980 Moscow Olympics medallist said.Other posts to be contested next month include the positions of President, Vice President, Assistant Secretary General, Treasurer, Assistant treasurer, 10 executive committee members, three Olympian posts and athletes representatives
