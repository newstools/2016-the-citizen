Trevor Noah doesn t seem to have a glass ceiling. The South African superstar officially launched his memoir Born a Crime and Other Stories in the United States on Wednesday. The self-penned memoir is an inside look into his life growing up bi-racial in South Africa during the last leg of apartheid. The book has been met with acclaim from local and international audiences with book reviewers stating that not only is the book extremely funny, but it s also extremely insightful. In its review, Entertainment Weekly says, Noah s not the main character in his own story his mother is constant. Foe of the status quo, her presence looms large over every page whether she s mentioned or not, and by the end, Noah lovingly makes clear that this book belongs to her this isn t one of those comedian-penned essay collections where the yuks jump out at sitcom speeds. Yet there s still plenty of humour; Noah proves to be a gifted storyteller, able to lace poignant tales with amusing irony. Cosmopolitan calls the memoir mind-blowing, stating; The Daily Show host, born to a black mother and a white father, was a living, breathing crime growing up in apartheid South Africa. His story of surviving and thriving is mind-blowing. Except for a hard copy, the book was also released on audio. The audiobook is performed by Noah and recounts his experiences during the twilight of apartheid in South Africa and the tumultuous days of freedom that followed. Noah has also managed to find his footing one late night on American TV.
