The Gauteng Health Department has denied claims that Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba s friend, Solly Moutlana, died at Steve Biko Academic Hospital after doctors left him unattended for over three hours. Mashaba went onto social media on Saturday, stating that his friend Moutlana was killed by President Jacob Zuma s blue light brigade in Pretoria on Friday. He told The Citizen on Sunday that Moutlana was left unattended at the hospital and died shortly after his family arrived. Health department spokesperson Steve Mabona said Moutlana was taken to Tshwane District Hospital by ambulances and was never treated at Steve Biko Academic Hospital. According to our records the ambulance took him directly from the accident scene to the Tshwane District Hospital and he was seen by at least two doctors. It is important [to] indicate that, for about two hours and forty-five minutes, he was treated at the accident and emergency [unit]. Unfortunately, he passed away from his severe internal injuries, Mabona said.
