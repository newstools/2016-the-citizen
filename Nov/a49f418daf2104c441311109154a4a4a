Shoppers and the public were graced by song and parades by the Tshwane metro police at an impromptu flash mob at Menlyn Shopping Centre on Friday. Male and female officers, dressed in their neat uniforms, broke out in song when the choral group performed. An impressive marching band and drill squad saluted to the crowd after their sterling and synchronised act.
