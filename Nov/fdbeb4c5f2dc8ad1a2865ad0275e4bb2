&#8220;Aspas will join the group in the place of Diego Costa, sidelined through injury,&#8221; the Spanish football federation said on Twitter. Costa, 28, has not trained with the group for a few days as he struggles with a groin problem. Spain, top of Group G ahead of Italy, are also preparing for a friendly against England at Wembley on Tuesday.
