At a poignant moment when the future of environmental policy hangs in the balance, National Geographic s climate change documentary Before the Flood reached more than 60 million people worldwide and surpassed a record-setting one billion minutes viewed across linear, digital, streaming and social platforms making it one of the most-watched documentaries in history and the most-watched National Geographic film yet. Produced by and starring Academy Award-winner Leonardo DiCaprio, the film presents a riveting account of the dramatic changes occurring around the world due to climate change, as well as the actions we as individuals and as a society need to take to prevent catastrophic disruption of life on our planet. DiCaprio interviews individuals from every facet of society in developing and developed nations who provide unique, impassioned and pragmatic views on what must be done now and in the future to transition economic and political systems into environmentally friendly institutions. But last week s election in the United States underscores the urgency of the issue, and this film. Our new administration could dismantle all the good and forward momentum that has occurred over the past few years if election campaign promises are actually kept, says director Fisher Stevens. However, let s do everything in our power to make president-elect Donald Trump understand that man-made climate change is not only real, but is happening at an alarming rate. We are currently trying to get him to watch the film and to get Leo and other leaders in the climate movement an audience with the president-elect. The documentary first aired in South Africa on October 30.
