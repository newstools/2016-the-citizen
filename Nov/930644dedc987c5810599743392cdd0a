Less than two months ago, BMW took the wraps off its next 5 Series Sedan, which is set to hit our dealership floors in February next year, but the Munich-based automaker is already introducing the first addition to the range by rolling out some optional M Performance treats. . With SA set to receive only four engine derivatives from launch, sales are set to kick start from February 2017. First things first, the German carmaker also has some power boosts available for select versions. The 540i (previously 535i) with its inline-six turbocharged 3.0-litre engine can be massaged to deliver an extra 25 kW and 50 Nm for a grand total of 265 kW and 500 Nm. The 540i and the two 530d models can be had with an M Performance silencer, while all flavours of the 5 Series Sedan family are available with beefier brakes featuring aluminium four-piston callipers on the front axle and single-piston callipers at the back. The callipers are finished in red and work together with inner vented, perforated lightweight discs to provide superior stopping power. . The exterior gains a new add-on parts featuring a carbon fibre finish for the front bumper, rear spoiler and diffuser. Black side sill attachments are also part of the deal and can be ordered with a carbon fibre look, while the rear diffuser and spoiler can be made from polyurethane. To spice things up even further, BMW can paint the kidney grille in black and apply a carbon fibre finish on the side mirror caps. . The diesel-powered 530d and its all-paw 530d xDrive counterpart fitted with an inline-six engine will get an optional bump in output of 20 kW and 30 Nm to 215 kW and 650 Nm. Initially, BMW SA will launch the 540i, 520d, 530d and 530i derivatives with sales set to kick off from February. . Details of the range-topping M5 remain unclear, but we expect it to arrive in the latter part of 2017.
