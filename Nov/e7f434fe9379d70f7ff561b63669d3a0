We do not think last year this time Ntombezinhle &#8216;DJ Zinhle&#8217; Jiyane thought her life would be as lit as it is right now. The DJ is definitely winning at this life thing. This year alone, the DJ has celebrated her daughter&#8217;s first birthday, her watch and bracelet range seems to be doing better, and she has found love with Brendon Naidoo. It is no surprise that a song has come out of all that happiness, and its title Colours says it all. Zinhle shared the song, which features Tamara Dey, on Twitter, and her fans are loving it. &#8220;I just heard the song right now&#8230;.MAMI ITS A BANGER the track is on . #bigup mama Kairo,&#8221; said one follower, while others said they could not wait for the full track to be released.
