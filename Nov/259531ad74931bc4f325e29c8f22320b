Kenny &#8220;The Sushi King&#8221; Kunene was quick to spring to President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s defence again on Thursday evening after a hoax poster falsely advertising a memorial lecture for a deceased Zuma started doing the rounds on social media. EFF deputy president Floyd Shivambu commented on the poster and said that his former organisation was being &#8220;quite prophetic&#8221;. He even went as far as to jokingly call Zuma the &#8220;ex-president&#8221;, since anyone who&#8217;s dead can reasonably be inferred to be an ex. So the youth league has a memorial lecture of the ex-president. They are quite prophetic. pic.twitter.com/zmLCVxD74c &mdash; Floyd Shivambu (@FloydShivambu) November 24, 2016 One-time-huge-Zuma-critic-turned-Zuma&#8217;s-biggest-fan Kunene, however, failed to get the joke, soon tweeting in response what was meant to be a sarcastic message &#8220;thanking&#8221; his one-time friend Shivambu for letting him know about the ANC Youth League&#8217;s programme. He called the hoax poster which most of social media has been laughing at an &#8220;excellent advert&#8221;. Kunene failed to grasp that a memorial lecture can only be held for a dead person. All the same, he held forth about the virtues of Zuma not being captured by the West. . The youth league of course, has nothing to do with this poster, which was made all the funnier because the keynote speaker was supposedly Deputy Minister of Defence Kebby Maphatsoe, who has been out of the spotlight after a picture of him naked was leaked on social media. The league in the province has denied any knowledge of the lecture and further clarified any confusion that the poster may have caused regarding whether the president is still alive (he is, by the way). &#8220;We have no knowledge of such an event organised by the ANCYL Western Cape. The ANCYL would like to inform young people of the province that President Zuma is very much alive and present.&#8221; The league further said Maphatsoe was also not aware of the event. &#8220;The office of Comrade Kebby Maphatsoe has informed us that Comrade Kebby is not aware nor has he been invited to such an event. A few Twitter users made fun of Kunene&#8217;s gaffe: https://twitter.com/bentselasammy/status/801818623278981121 @Kenny_T_Kunene @ANCYLhq @FloydShivambu memorial lecture Ntate . Ke tshepa oe hlokometse &mdash; MoAfrika . (@BabsySenyane) November 24, 2016 Mo Afrika saying &#8220;Ke tshepa oe hlokometse&#8221; means &#8220;I hope you noticed (that it&#8217;s a memorial lecture)&#8221;. Kunene clearly doesn&#8217;t care about all of this and hasn&#8217;t deleted the tweet (as yet).
