Faf du Plessis being charged with ball tampering after footage emerged of an incident involving the South African cricket captain during their second Test against Australia in Hobart this week, couldn t have come at a worse time. The footage appears to show him with a sweet, or mint, in his mouth and rubbing saliva onto the ball, with the International Cricket Council (ICC) alleging he broke their code of conduct. So with Australian cricket in all sorts of trouble after losing the three-match Test series with one still to play which prompted the chairman of national selectors Rod Marsh to step down this week is this sour grapes or sour sweets, as veteran batsman Hashim Amla put it yesterday? Amla, in supporting his captain with the rest of the team yesterday, initially thought it was a joke. It s not April, but the allegation against Faf was &#8230; a really ridiculous thing. &#8220;As a team, we re standing strong, we ve done nothing wrong. It s basically a joke, said Amla. I ve had sweets in my mouth, bubblegum in my mouth, biltong, nuts I m not sure what the big deal is. To a lot of people, it s sounding more like sour sweets. The timing of this is unfortunate. Fresh from a 5-0 drubbing the Proteas handed the Australians in the one-day international series at home last month, South Africa, starved of their injured big-name stars AB de Villiers and Dale Steyn, lead 2-0 in the Test series. It brings welcome relief and hope to a team that lost its way last year.
