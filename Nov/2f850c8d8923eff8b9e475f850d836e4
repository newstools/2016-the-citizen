As the festive season approaches, members of society saving groups, commonly known as stokvels in South Africa, will inevitably withdraw money from various bank branches in a bid to hand out money to members, but Standard Bank issues a warning to customers not to become crime victims. Standard Bank&#8217;s senior manager of customer financial solutions, Riaan Appelgrein, issued to following tips for members to avoid becoming crime targets when withdrawing their money. Encourage members to rather receive their money directly into their bank accounts. Arrange for your local branch to make payments directly to retailers if possible. Your bank can also provide you with a bank cheque (this is a Bank Guaranteed cheque) that can be drawn for a specific beneficiary. Don t advertise your plans to visit the bank. Make sure that you are not followed when you do go to the bank, and be aware of suspicious people around you when you are in the bank, and again, also be on the lookout for people following you when you leave. Avoid visiting the bank on high-risk days, which are Mondays, Fridays or just after month-end. Stagger withdrawals into smaller amounts over different days. This way, you won t lose all your cash at once, should you be the victim of a crime. ALSO READ: Sea rescue helps fishermen after boat capsizes Caxton News Service
