ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe has described the Democratic Alliance s (DA) motion of no confidence against President Jacob Zuma an annual frivolous ritual that is fast losing its meaning and bound to fail. ALSO READ: State of Capture report makes no conclusive findings ANC Mantashe was briefing the media on Tuesday in Johannesburg after the conclusion of the governing party s National Working Committee (NWC), saying calls for President Jacob Zuma to step down after the release of the State of Capture report were hurried because the document found nobody guilty of anything. Calls for the stepping down of the president using the report as the basis thereof. As far as we are concerned, they are premature and unfounded, Mantashe said. Mantashe also said the ANC supports the establishment of a commission of inquiry to probe the allegations contained in the report. However, he seemed to take issue with former public protector Thuli Madonsela s recommendation that the inquiry be headed by an independent judge chosen by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng. Earlier on Tuesday, the DA s chief whip in parliament John Steenhuisen confirmed he received a letter from National Assembly speaker Baleke Mbete acceding to the vote on Thursday. This will be Zuma s fifth motion of no confidence since 2012. Previous motions of no confidence have been easily voted down by the African National Congress majority in the National Assembly and an impeachment motion tabled by the opposition in response to Zuma s handling of the Nkandla scandal went the same way.
