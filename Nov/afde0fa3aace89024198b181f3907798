Two separate cases of severe animal cruelty have left officers of the Lower South Coast SPCA in KwaZulu-Natal disturbed. In one case, a dog had to be put down after it was doused with acid, South Coast Herald reported. Field officer Liesl Bolton and trainee field officer Tammy Nel reportedly found a man had thrown battery acid on to a dog that had apparently come on to his property to eat his chickens and eggs last week Saturday.

Trainee officer Nel said her leg felt like it was on fire after the dog urinated on her out of fear. The acid was not only eating away the dog s flesh, but her organs inside must have been on fire, she said. In another case last week, the officers responded to a call to a house in Marburg. They found a dog with a chain so tight around its neck that the metal had become embedded into its skin, leaving a severely septic wound. The dog, which was about eight, was in so much pain that we couldn t touch his back, and we were left with no option but to sedate it at the premises, said Bolton. When I tried to stroke the dog, it shied away in pain, almost like it was saying: Don t touch me, don t touch me , added Nel. The wound was not treatable, and the animal had to be put down. Bolton said chaining of dogs was prohibited and illegal. Cases have been opened under the Animal Protection Act. &#8211; Caxton News Service
