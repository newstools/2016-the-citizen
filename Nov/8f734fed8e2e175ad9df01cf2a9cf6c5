The OR Tambo International Airport responded politely to radio personality Gareth Cliff&#8217;s snide Twitter comment against the airport on Monday. This after Cliff called for Airports Company South Africa (Acsa) to get its &#8220;sh*t together&#8221; in a tweet. The tweet was accompanied by a picture of a small broken pole at the airport, which is managed by Acsa. &#8220;ACSA, get your sh*t together,&#8221; tweeted the radio man. In response, the company wrote: &#8220;Hi @GarethCliff, Thank you for notifying us of this, this has been fixed. Have a great day further,&#8221; using its official account @ortambo_int. It&#8217;s not clear why a small broken pole was such a problem to the now-resigned Idols SA judge. It could be that his resignation from the TV show had left him in a bit of a bad mood. During court proceedings earlier this year when M-Net management had tried to defend its axing of Cliff after he defended Penny Sparrow&#8217;s right to call black people monkeys as free speech, it emerged that he earned R356 000 as an Idols judge from 1 February 2015 to 30 November 2015. Nicole Petyt ( @nicole_petyt) thought, however, that Cliff&#8217;s irritation was down to a question of high airport pricing through taxes on flights charged by Acsa. Acsa&#8217;s fees make South African airports among the most expensive in the world. She commented by saying: &#8220;ACSA charges so much, should be fixed immediately.&#8221; @matsha187 responed to Cliff, saying: &#8216;@GarethCliff he banna, dont things get damaged. Is this now a sign of poor management?&#8221; Steven Kilfoil ( @StevenKilfoil) responded by saying: &#8220;@GarethCliff that&#8217;s been broken since last week Tuesday. They really couldn&#8217;t care less.&#8221; ACSA, get your shit together pic.twitter.com/jX4TtdXmCq &mdash; Gareth Cliff (@GarethCliff) November 14, 2016 &nbsp;
