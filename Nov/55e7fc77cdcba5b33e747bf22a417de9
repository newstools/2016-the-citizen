Now the dust has started to settle on the presidential poll and Donald Trump has been confirmed as the president-elect of the American people, it is perhaps apposite to draw some comparisons between his surprise victory and the bombshell of Britain s Brexit . For despite the diverse nature of this week s decision by the 200 million-strong American electorate and the result of the British referendum in June in which 52% of votes were cast in favour of leaving the European Union, the emotive message underlying both outcomes has a strikingly common base. It was simply this: our country belongs to us, we want to reclaim it for ourselves and the devil take those who stand against us. Against predictions to the contrary, the Brexit vote swung more on a growing fear among British citizens of a perceived threat from hordes of immigrants legal or illegal overrunning the so-called traditional way of life, swamping the schools and health and social services, than about the warnings of the economists that slamming the door on Europe would cost the United Kingdom dear in the long-term. Trump ran on a similar platform, one which raised the risible notion of building a wall across the southern border of the United States to stem unwanted Mexican immigration. Trump though went several steps further, promising employment and prosperity to the same pressured sector of society that had been most deeply affected by the lure of Brexit, while managing to alienate everyone from the Hispanics, who had taken the opening salvo, to African-Americans, Muslims, Jews and women. Everyone, that is, but the voters who counted, the majority (though Clinton actually won the popular vote) who, as they had in Britain, had the final say. There is surely a message about the very veniality of the politics of this. But equally certainly is it cannot really be that exclusion equals freedom.
