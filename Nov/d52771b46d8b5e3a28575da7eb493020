African National Congress (ANC) deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte on Tuesday said a motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma tabled by the EFF in the National Assembly won t succeed, as it would only seek to destabilise the national legislature. ALSO READ: Mantashe says ANC had more important things to do than fire Zuma We are not surprised that our opposition do this all the time; this is the only weapon that they have. They have no programme, they have no plan. They only have a way of creating disturbance by destabilising parliament itself; such a vote of no confidence doesn t really worry us at all. Bring it on if the EFF wants to; let s see what happens. There are no ghosts that we are chasing around. We believe that every enemy of our revolution has a right to do whatever they wish to do to try to destabilise the revolution. We are equally determined for them not to succeed, she said.
