The Australian media took their efforts to get under the Proteas skins to new levels on Monday as a Channel 9 news reporter had to be physically restrained to prevent him from barging his way through the players and shoving a microphone under captain Faf du Plessis nose. Ever since a video went viral in Australia of the captain eating a sweet and applying saliva to the ball during South Africa s series-clinching win in Hobart, the local media have been unrelenting in their pressure on Du Plessis. Even though Du Plessis is not allowed to speak on the forthcoming disciplinary hearing over his ball-tampering charge due to International Cricket Council rules, that did not stop Will Crouch, who is built like a rugby forward and was not wearing any accreditation, from pushing his way into the Proteas group in his efforts to get to the captain as the players walked through Adelaide airport. ALSO READ: Faf charged with ball tampering Manager Mohammed Moosajee was shoved out of the way by Crouch, at which point Proteas security official Zunaid Wadee shouldered Crouch away, into a glass door, which did not break. Moosajee issued a statement later on Monday to register the team s disgust at the incident. The Australian media and Channel 9 News in particular have been advised on numerous occasions over the past few days that Cricket South Africa and captain Faf du Plessis are not in a position to comment on the alleged ball-tampering issue. However, despite our best intentions to co-operate with the Australian media, Channel 9 News behaviour has been disappointing, Moosajee said. Cricket South Africa CEO Haroon Lorgat is arriving in Australia today, at which point a decision will be made as to whether to lay an official complaint with Cricket Australia.
