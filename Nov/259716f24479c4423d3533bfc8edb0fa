One of the architects of the South African constitution, Zam Titus, has called for the rejigging of the local government system so it can include the people. Speaking at the two-day SA Local Government Association (Salga) conference in Johannesburg, Titus said a new approach in local government had to look at relevant training needs, and resources needed for municipalities to enhance service delivery. I think we have over-regulated the local government, Titus said. But we cannot throw away the baby with the bath water. Titus said it was a fallacy that one departmental director-general could automatically become the head of another department because something would fail due to lack of relevant expertise needed by different departments. Independent political analyst Somadoda Fikeni said the environment had become rife with patronage. People depend on the leader, so they defend the leader instead of the values of the institution, Fikeni said. He suggested that South Africans should nurture organic leadership, which he described as a leader who is embedded within his community.
