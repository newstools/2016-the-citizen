Recent weeks have seen speculation mount that the 36-year-old former England skipper could be mulling a possible coaching role at former club Liverpool &#8212; or even take a playing role at Celtic. Gerrard is now out of contract at LA Galaxy after the club exited the MLS playoffs earlier this month with a shootout defeat to Colorado. &#8220;Special place, incredible view, I will miss you LA,&#8221; read a Gerrard post to Instagram which showed the Los Angeles city lights in the background. Galaxy coach Bruce Arena said last Wednesday he hoped Gerrard might extend his stay as reports emerged in the British media that the midfield star of Liverpool&#8217;s 2005 Champions League win was seeking a coaching or playing role back in Britain. Last month, as the speculation first began to emerge on Gerrard&#8217;s future, Liverpool coach Jurgen Klopp would not be drawn on whether the former Anfield hero might have a future role on his staff. But the German did indicate that &#8220;Stevie Gerrard is always so welcome at Liverpool FC, you can t imagine how welcome.&#8221; While it is understood that does not mean there is a coaching role in the offing at Anfield, those comments leave open the possibility of an ambassadorial role. In a previous Instagram post, Gerrard had already indicated that he was looking ahead to life beyond his Californian stint. &#8220;Living in Los Angeles and playing for the great Galaxy supporters has been a privilege. You have made this place feel like home to me. This city and this club will always hold a special place in my heart. Thank you,&#8221; he said
