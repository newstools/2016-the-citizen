Eskom s reputation has been put into disrepute by the public protector s statements. Letsatsi-Duba said the board would have to convene as a matter of urgency to appoint an interim CEO to fill Molefe s shoes when he left. Eskom chairperson Baldwin Ngubane said the decision taken by Molefe was regrettable.
