One Friday evening while standing at the ATM queue at the service station to draw some money for a Friday night out, a BMW e30 325iS which really made me recall the seamless 325iS my father owned in the late 90s showed up impeccably, and looking all-original. My father had given it over to my 35-year-old brother after it developed some fuel injection snags and he [Dad] wasn&#8217;t really prepared for such a thing. I never got to see the car ever again. . Right after admiring the 325iS, which brought back all those memories of the long-gone &#8220;Gusheshe&#8221; my dad had, it made its noise and off it headed to the east disappearing in the taxi jammed Soweto streets. The e30 325iS is now being sought after by collectors who are willing to pay at least double the launch price for a clean factory-standard example. They are also properly respected by the youth, who are often younger than the vehicle itself. What s in the name &#8230; Gusheshe ? So much is said about it, and so many people want it. Some lucky individuals own one, but don&#8217;t want to part with it. To refresh your mind a bit, the 325iS (commonly referred to on the street as the &#8220;Gusheshe&#8221;) was aimed at dethroning the dominant Big Boss Kadett 16V in Class A of the exciting and competitive Stannic Group N Production Car Championship series. . It was launched in the first half of 1990, was equipped with aluminium doors, fenders and bonnet, was fitted with the 5-stud race-tuned suspension from the European BMW e30 M3 (never made available in SA due to its right-hand only production) and was, most importantly, endowed with a butter-smooth, Alpina-fettled, 2.7-litre version of BMW&#8217;s M20 straight-six engine, spec&#8217;d at a healthy 145 kW @ 5800rpm and 265 Nm @ 4000rpm.

BMW claimed a 0-100 time of 7.5 seconds and a top speed of just over 225km/h, which was quite something for its time.

It is hailed as the car of all cars among local drag racers and car fanatics in Mzansi for its spinning, racing and drifting capabilities.
