Police will relentlessly pursue those responsible for police killings, the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) said on Sunday. This followed the murder of three police officers in Cape Town this past week. The attacks also left three other officers wounded, Captain Lloyd Ramovha said. Constable Masibonge Mqwada, 33, was shot dead in Kraaifontein while reportedly dropping off a relative just after 1am on Saturday. Three armed assailants attacked in an apparent hijacking attempt. Constable Thandoxolo Ndiki, 30, was found laying on a street pavement in Delft around 3.30am on the same day, with what appeared to be gunshot wounds to the upper body. He was taken to hospital but later succumbed to his wounds. His vehicle was recovered in Muizenberg on Sunday afternoon. The motive for the attack was still unclear at this stage. Constable Amanda Ladlokova was shot dead on Tuesday night while on duty in Philippi East. The circumstances surrounding these murders were being investigated and one suspect had already been arrested and appeared in court during the week for the murder of Ladlokova, Ramovha said. Hawks head Lt-Gen Berning Ntlemeza said police attacks remained a priority crime, as this threatened the safety of communities. We shall continue to relentlessly pursue all [those] responsible in carrying out the directorate s mandate of ensuring that all people are, and feel safe in the country. An attack on a police officer is an attack on the state, he said.
