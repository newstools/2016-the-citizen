As heavy downpours continued in Gauteng, Premier David Makhura intends declaring some parts of the province disaster areas. Johannesburg and Ekurhuleni have experienced the worst flash floods on Wednesday, causing extensive damage to infrastructure, homes and motor vehicles, and killing at least six people. Makhura, who arrived on Thursday from attending a conference in Namibia, received a report from MEC of cooperative governance and traditional affairs and human settlements Paul Mashatile, who was the acting premier in his absence, of the scale of the damage and the casualties. A significant number of our citizens from across Gauteng are continuing to be displaced as the heavy rains continue into the weekend, Makhura said yesterday.

We are taking the necessary steps to declare a disaster so that we can tap into all available resources to assist those affected . The provincial government urged residents living in low-lying areas to take special care during sudden floods. Residents living next to rivers and streams must evacuate to a safer place or to higher ground when water rises. The provincial government, along with the Johannesburg and Ekurhuleni municipalities, will continue to work together to assist those affected by the floods and will attend to upgrades to prevent future disasters of this nature, Makhura said.
