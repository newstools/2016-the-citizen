The Tshwane University of Technology is adamant that final examinations will get under way on Monday despite ongoing disruptions by Fees Must Fall protesters at its campuses. The university said it took a decision to move the final examinations to the Tshwane Events Centre following disruptions at the Soshanguve campus on Thursday. Transport to and from the venue will be provided. Students will have to produce a student card and personalised final exam timetable before they will be allowed to utilise the transport provided. Security measures at all the university campuses, including the distant campuses in eMalahleni, Mbombela and Polokwane, will be reinforced. The SAPS have been engaged to remain on standby during the examination period, TUT management said.
