The straight concept of state capture is simple enough for the average South African to grasp. But the serpentine twists and turns of how that capture might have been achieved is patently more than our citizens can ever hope to compute en masse. What we know for certain is that the release of former public prosecutor Thuli Madonsela s report on state capture has raised a dust storm of epic proportions with a lemming-like rush of people implicated heading for any cover available. We have a finance minister in Pravin Gordhan, hastily dragged back into a post he vacated to try to drag an economy in the first stages of what dire warnings have diagnosed as its death throes. Gordhan steadies the ship and then National Prosecuting Authority head Shaun Abrahams announces that the minister and two of his former colleagues are to be charged with fraud. Then Abrahams changes his mind, announcing the charges are to be dropped, while distancing himself personally from the investigation and saying he would fire whoever was responsible, typical of the some-other-guy-did-it defence.

This alone is a mental minefield to tax even those with minds deeply embedded in conspiracy theory. Yet few who follow the straight path of logic must recognise there s something deeply amiss in this merry-go-round approach that boils down to what looks awfully like a sustained attack on an individual and the important office he occupies; a feeling that more and more fiddles are reading off a score lit by the fires burning around them. The key to unravelling it all is the judicial commission of inquiry Madonsela has called for. The sooner this happens the better.
