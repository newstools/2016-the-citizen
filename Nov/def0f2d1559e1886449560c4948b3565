We are fully behind the world authorities trying to stamp out ball tampering. It is, if you pardon the cliche, simply not cricket. But the almost unseemly rush to bring Proteas captain Faf du Plessis up before a hearing is not truly within the conventionally perceived fairness of the game, either. That he was found guilty of using a mixture of saliva and a mint he was chewing in what was seen as an attempt to alter the trajectory of the ball in the second Test in Hobart is largely irrelevant and Du Plessis was cleared to lead his team out for the third Test in Adelaide on Thursday. But it must be noted that the haste injected into the hearing allowed him scant time to summon his own legal council from South Africa. In contrast, there was no follow-up on allegations that Indian captain Virat Kohli used the residue of a sweet to shine the ball in the first Test against England in Rajkot, a mirror image of the accusations levelled at Du Plessis. The issue is that there cannot be two interpretations of what is considered an infringement against the spirit of the game. Consistency must surely be the key consideration.
