It was Australia&#8217;s third-lowest innings total in tests against South Africa. Joe Burns (1) was caught in his crease LBW to Kyle Abbott, before Usman Khawaja fell for 4 edging to the slips. Australia&#8217;s only real resistance came through captain Steve Smith (48 not out). Adam Voges fell first ball to Philander with an edge to the keeper, leaving Callum Ferguson to face a hat-trick ball on his first delivery in Test cricket. Ferguson survived, but fell soon after when a slip on the crease saw him run out brilliantly by substitute fielder Dane Vilas on in place of Philander, who had been injured by Smith running into him. Philander was the chief destroyer with a phenomenal 5/21. In total, 15 wickets fell on the day, leaving the South Africans in the hunt for more runs tomorrow and hoping to put huge pressure on the Aussies again when they come back in to bat. Promisingly, Hashim Amla managed to get some runs again.
