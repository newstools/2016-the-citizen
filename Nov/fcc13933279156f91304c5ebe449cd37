Minister of Sports and Recreation Fikile Mbalula has revealed a few things about himself that he normally wouldn&#8217;t tweet about. In an interview with Anele Mdoda on Real Talk, the minister opened up about his struggle days, what he thinks of EFF leader Julius Malema and the one-night stand he had with a Joburg model in 2011. Mbalula unexpectedly sang Malema&#8217;s praises, saying being in the struggle had played a role in who the EFF leader has become. &#8220;There is nothing Julius can tell you besides the struggle,&#8221; he said. Malema had always fought for what he believed in and was a brave man, said the minister. &#8220;If he believes in something, he&#8217;ll fight for it.&#8221; He further told Mdoda that Malema was not the kind of person who &#8220;buys&#8221; friendship. &#8220;Even if the previous night you were drinking with him, he will tell you that you&#8217;re a coward the following day if you are disagreeing on something. &#8220;He is very intelligent.&#8221; Though he had nothing but good things to say about the EFF leader, he said that if Malema were to be president &#8220;then I&#8217;ll be dead&#8221;. The two seem had a good relationship when Malema was still in the ANC, with Malema taking over the Youth League from the older man in 2008. Mbalula says Malema had been his biggest critic even then. African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) leader, Julius Malema and Minister of Sport and previous chairman of the youth league, Fikile Mbalula at a gala dinner held in Nelspruit, South Africa on 5 March 2011. Picture: Gallo Images &#8220;Julius Malema was my biggest critic; when I started [as sports minister], he told me that they had undermined [me] by giving [me] a sports portfolio.&#8221; Though he is always at the receiving end of criticism, Mbalula says the only time he faced a difficult situation was when the woman he had experienced a one-night stand with accused him of impregnating her. He said that what made it worse was the reports claiming the woman was his girlfriend when &#8220;she was just a one-night stand&#8221;. &#8220;I always wanted to defend myself against it and Gwede Mantashe once said to me: &#8216;Look, if you have done something wrong, just admit it and apologise, because you have done something wrong; you&#8217;re a married man.'&#8221; He later bought his wife a diamond to apologise to her.

He says he spends some nights in studio producing music for artists but has never claimed royalties for the hits. &#8220;Kalawa Jazmee [Records] is my family; those are my boys; we stay in the studio.&#8221; In fact, when DJ Oskido runs out of ideas in studio, Mbalula is the one he calls. He says they have tried to produce an album for Khanyi Mbau, but it did not work out so they only did a song for her, though he didn&#8217;t reveal which one. Perhaps the one thing most of us did not know is that Mbalula&#8217;s biggest friend was the late Lebo Mathosa. He says he met his wife when he was with Mathosa; in fact, she was the one who told him he would marry her. And he did.
