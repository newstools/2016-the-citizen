It has become increasingly manifest that the schisms within the ANC are growing with each passing day President Jacob Zuma continues to ignore the obvious and continues to cling to his embattled power base as leader of the party and the government. He has lost the support of large sections of the tripartite alliance he heads, though many of the lesser lights continue to keep their heads below the parapet, the unions are growing in militancy and have begun to ignore party directives on deciding the path they will take on subjects like the succession debate, and the South African Communist Party has come out and openly criticised Zuma and threatened to stand under their own banner in the next elections. Added to this is the inefficacy of Collen Maine as head of the ANC Youth League, the once powerful base which Nelson Mandela helped form in 1944 before his fellow Young Lions launched their ultimately successful tilt at the ANC conservatives during the late 40s, and the decision by the party to expel Julius Malema and open the door for the birth and rise of the EFF.

He is also facing a stinging backlash from the struggle stalwarts, who have made futile attempts to meet face to face with the president in the past and who maintain Zuma has brought shame to both the ANC and the country and failed dismally to deal decisively with corruption, nepotism and factionalism. That as many as 101 of these veterans met on Sunday represents a significant number even within a party which has been ring-fenced internally to protect its leaders. Clearly, the common touch and easy populism which Zuma once displayed is lifting like a summer mist. Yet the president has defiantly withstood growing calls to step down. The chorus toward this end, it seems, continues to swell.
