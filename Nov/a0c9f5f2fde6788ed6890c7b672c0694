Residents from Ennerdale in the south of Johannesburg were on Monday night left shocked and worried after a tornado hit the area. The latest incident, which left several houses and vehicles damaged, comes almost four months after another tornado hit Tembisa in Ekurhuleni. Strong winds accompanied by heavy rainfall blew off roof tiles from several houses in Extension 9. Speaking to The Citizen, one of the affected residents, Penny Tshazibane, said she and her family were coming back from work and school when they found everything &#8220;upside down&#8221;. The tiles from the one of the bedrooms were blown away while our gate was also off the rails. We never expected this to happen, but there is nothing we can do because we prayed for the rain and it came and we will just have to fix where we can, she said. A few streets from there, a wall fell on top of a stationary vehicle. While residents there were still reeling in shock and assessing the damage caused by the storms, several roads in and out of Ennerdale were also flooded. The Old Vereeniging, which in recent months underwent upgrading and extension work, was also flooded. At least two vehicles were involved in an accident, but details around the exact cause were still sketchy late last night as police officers were still conducting their own investigations. There were no fatalities in that incident. These incidents came barely hours after the South African Weather Service issued an alert for the possibility of severe thunderstorms. Earlier in the day, forecaster Madimetja Thema warned that residents should brace themselves for rainfall and possible thunderstorms for the better part of this week.
