Van Niekerk, who broke the 400m world record to win gold at the Rio Olympics, joined Jamaican speedster Usain Bolt and British distance runner Mo Farah among the final nominees for the prestigious accolade, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) revealed in a statement on Wednesday. The shortlist was determined by a voting process which involved IAAF members and fans. While Olympic 800m champion Caster Semenya had been included among nine nominees for the prestigious women&#8217;s award, she did not make the final cut, with Ethiopian distance runner Almaz Ayana, Jamaican sprinter Elaine Thompson and Polish hammer thrower Anita Wlodarczyk all receiving the nod. The winners would be announced at a gala ceremony in Monaco on December 2, the IAAF confirmed, with Van Niekerk hoping to become the first SA athlete in 13 years to receive the global accolade.
