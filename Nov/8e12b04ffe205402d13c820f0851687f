Minnie&#8217;s diva demands were not fully accommodated by Tswelopele Productions who are shooting the current season of the Tropika show in the Seychelles. According to Sunday World, Minnie threw a fit when she requested that her personal glam team, made up of a stylist and social media team join her in the Seychelles. While she was granted her stylist, she was told it was unnecessary for her social media team to fly out as well. &#8220;A social media team had already been booked and confirmed for the shoot and it was therefore not neccessary for Ms Dlamini&#8217;s team to accompany her,&#8221; said Tswelopele legal manager Loumar Botha.

I specifically asked not to be considered if they were looking two presenters. Then last minute they wanted to introduce a co-host which I refused as per initial agreement. There was conflict on the island as a result,&#8221; she said. Minnie would not comment on claims she made diva demands.
