Communications officer of the Bayview police Warrant Officer Collin Chetty confirmed the incident and said a case of rape was opened at the Bayview police last Wednesday and was being investigated by the Chatsworth Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit. Chatsworth Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences (FCS) Unit s Colonel Ellappen said: The child had been raped on several occasions by the accused. She travelled with the accused on a daily basis, and this is a serious matter which goes beyond this incident, as the man had other children in his care as well. We are appealing to parents to question their children with regards to the day-to-day events when they are away from home.

Children should also be taught that their bodies are sacred and that nobody has a right to touch it. They should be taught about the good touch and the bad touch as well. Parents should have an open relationship with their children to encourage them to have the confidence to tell their parents everything, added Ellappen.
