Lizzie Allen, a white South African woman, has come out to condemn the coffin assault on Rethabile Mlotshwa by farmers Willem Oosthuizen and Theo Martins Jackson. Allen and her friends have started a campaign to raise money for Mlotshwa, hoping to give him &#8220;a Christmas to remember&#8221;. Speaking to 702, Allen said though some people may think it was strange for her to raise funds, she said it was a good gesture from white South Africans to the guy who was treated &#8220;in the most heartbreaking, appalling&#8221; way. She said she went on social media and saw other white people who were &#8220;disgusted&#8221; and &#8220;appalled&#8221; at the act, only that they were doing it behind closed doors. &#8220;So this is our way to publicly say &#8216;we as white South Africans are not with you, we don&#8217;t agree with you and our hearts go out to Rethabile&#8217;. Maybe it&#8217;s a strange thing to reach into your pocket to help someone who&#8217;s terrorised. But actually words are cheap, but when you reach into your pocket, that&#8217;s in a way to show a sacrifice.&#8221; Also read: EFF: Mcebo ankle-cuffed in court, but not &#8216;coffin racists&#8217; &#8220;Some people are sort of saying, well, what are you going to do with your money? We&#8217;re trying to get hold of him to give him this pocket money which went from zero to R6 000 in the space of 24 hours.&#8221; Allen said they would just give the money to Mlotshwa and not monitor it. &#8220;It&#8217;s a gift; he can do whatever the hell he wants with it.&#8221; &#8220;We&#8217;re giving him as white South Africans to say, not all all white South Africans are like those two. In fact I think they are very much in the minority.&#8221; Allen was, however, criticised by some saying the fundraising was just a way of washing away the guilt. Oosthuizen and Jackson made headlines after a video of them allegedly assaulting a man and trying to burn him alive emerged. In the video, the two men can be seen assaulting a man who has been identified as Mlotshwa. One of the two men can be seen in the video forcing the seemingly terrified Mlotshwa into a brown coffin. The two withdrew their applications for bail in apparent fear of the angry community of Middelburg. Read more: &#8216;Coffin assault racists&#8217; prefer to stay in jail
