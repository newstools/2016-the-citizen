The controversial legislation seeking to put stringent regulations on the sale of liquor and tobacco has come under sharp criticism from small black liquor traders, who say it will damage their businesses. In a survey conducted at taverns, shebeens, restaurants, spazas and bottle stores in Gauteng, owners came out against Trade and Industry Minister Rob Davies National Liquor Policy Draft Bill and strict measures to regulate the use of tobacco announced by Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi. The survey was a joint initiative by the Gauteng Liquor Forum (GLF), the South African Liquor Traders Association (Salta) and the National Tourism Hospitality Association (NTHA). The three bodies collectively represent 35 000 small outlets. Sbo Hlatywayo, a member of the team who conducted the survey, said the study found that 93% of small business owners expected tougher regulation of liquor and tobacco to damage their businesses.

He said the move would hamper the growth of small businesses, instead of achieving 450 000 new small enterprises and creating 1.3 million jobs by 2019. NTHA president Fanny Mokoena said interventions to promote health were good, but there are better ways to achieve this, instead of introducing unnecessary laws&#8221;. We believe extreme laws are a short cut that should be avoided, Mokoena said. According to the survey, 71% supported a penalty being imposed on retailers found selling to underaged children. GLF president Linda Madida said the proposed removal of branding from cigarette packets would help crime syndicates sell illicit products. But Hlatywayo said the regulations would put the youth who sold tobacco out of business because the proposed law prohibited the display or advertising of tobacco.
