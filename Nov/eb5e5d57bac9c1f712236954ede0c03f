The time for talk of learning curves , special circumstances and long-term goals in relation to South African rugby ended with the 27-13 defeat of the Springboks by Wales in Cardiff at the weekend. It rounded out an annus horribilis with an unenviable record of eight Test defeats in 12 outings and has taken the Boks to a nadir never experienced before. We are increasingly told by the experts that we have the depth of rugby talent in this country to take on anyone. This is increasingly being met with derision by Springbok supporters as our national team limps from disaster to disaster in defeat after defeat. The glaring reality is that pouring all the talent in the world into a funnel will not help if a lack of thought blocks the filter and a paucity of planning clogs the result. The hierarchy that controls the game at boardroom level must be judged on this alone. The spin provided by fine words and lofty intentions no longer holds the ring of authenticity. Springbok coach Allister Coetzee, who has admittedly only been in the hot seat for seven months, must surely now fall on his sword. Equally, the boardroom brains trust must join him and a start should be made from scratch.
