As the government, we would like to shift to Dodoma and we shall appreciate if some ambassadors moved there too... my meeting with the envoys in the coming few days will entail looking at ways in which they can shift in phases, he saidHe said the ambassadors in Tanzania have many needs such as schools for their children and other matters they consider essential, but the government will work out how to meet their requirements.Last month Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa was the first to shift to Dodoma and other ministries are expected to will follow suit in due course.Meanwhile, UN-Tanzania Office has committed to continue supporting the youth by raising their awareness so that they can engage in development processes by ensuring that they have skills and knowledge to meet the needs of economic transformation.According to the UN, one of the challenges facing the country is the growing number of demands of the youth, so there is a need to ensure they become stakeholders in the values and principles that the international agency embraces.
