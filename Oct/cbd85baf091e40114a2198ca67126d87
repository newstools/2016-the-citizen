Dar es Salaam. Chadema and ACT-Wazalendo yesterday told off the ruling party for attacking opposition leaders, who criticise the performance of President John Magufuli.In separate press conferences, the two opposition parties challenged CCM publicity secretary Christopher Ole Sendeka for what he said on Friday. They told him that he and his party should tackle issues that were of paramount importance to Tanzanians instead of attacking people, who criticised the government.During their address, ACT-Wazalendo party called for the authorities to start investigating the wealth and debts of their leader Zitto Kabwe.The party issued a statement following accusations made by Mr Ole Sendeka yesterday on investing the wealth of Mr Kabwe.Although he did not give any specific reasons, Mr Sendeka attacked Mr Kabwe, who has been challenging the performance of President Magufuli, saying he was doing so for personal interests.
