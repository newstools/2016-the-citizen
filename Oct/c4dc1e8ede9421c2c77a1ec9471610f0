There are dozens of questions which Zuma promised he would answer, but instead served a notice on Madonsela to stop her from releasing her report on state capture.
According to The Sunday Times, Madonsela has received information that Duduzane Zuma was made a billionaire by the Guptas after he was made a director of Sahara, six months after his father became the president of the ANC. In addition, Duduzile was a director of Shiva Uranium and Oakbay Investments, which he resigned from earlier this year due to political pressure.

However, Zuma has not responded to any of Madonsela’s questions. His spokesperson, Bongani Nqukulunga, said the questions required the president to speak to at least 21 of the people interviewed Madonsela.
He said: “It is important to mention that the first time the president was asked to answer any questions was on October 2 2016. When the president met with the public protector on October 6 in Pretoria, he asked for the meeting to be postponed so he could get access to information that would enable him to answer the questions. The request was turned down and instead he was asked to answer written questions under oath.”

• It has been reported that a member of the Gupta family or a company linked to them assisted one of your wives to purchase a house in Waterkloof, Pretoria. Is this true and if so, why did they assist her?
• What were the reasons for your removal of Nhlanhla Nene as finance minister on 9 December 2015?
• What were the reasons for your appointment of Des van Rooyen as finance minister?

How do you respond to these allegations?
• You were required by section 2 in the Executive Ethics Code to: declare any personal or private financial or business interest that you or a family member may have in a matter in relation to which you are required to take a decision as a member of the executive; withdraw from any proceedings of cabinet considering a matter in which you or a family member has any financial or business interest unless you decide you or your family member’s interest is trivial or not relevant.
