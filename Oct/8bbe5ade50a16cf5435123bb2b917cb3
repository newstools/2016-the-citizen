While preparing for Sunday s second SAMCAR V8 Supercar race at Kyalami, the Fuchs Oils Holden of Larry Wilford backfired and set alight some spilt racing fuel, which immediately billowed into a three-metre high fireball. The blaze, which caused only minimal damage, was soon contained, and nobody was injured.
