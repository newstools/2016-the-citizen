Open-top motoring has been with us for many decades in various guises, from the smallest two-seater sports car to the more prestigious droptops under the widely sweeping title of an open tourer . In recent times, the trend has been towards the top end of the market place and this was emphatically demonstrated in the Cape Wine lands last week by the Mercedes Benz 2016 Dream Car Event, aptly sub-titled Look Up . The event featured the latest generation of the SL and SLC launched locally in July this year and the range was well represented. . The SL range available covered V6, V8 and V12 engine derivatives from the SL 400 and SL 500 to the mighty AMG SL 63 and AMG SL 65. The SLC assembly offered both 4 in line and V6 engines from the SLC 200, SLC 300 and the very lively AMG SLC 43. But it was the new kids on the block that took centre stage when the covers came off revealing, for the first time ever, a C-Class Cabriolet and the rebirth of the iconic S-Class Cabriolet, last appearing in the company catalogues of 1971. The extensive range of both C and S Class Cabriolets makes it almost impossible to feature them all here. There are no less than six C Class offerings, the C 200 and C 300 both powered by 1991cc petrol engines producing 135kW with 300Nm and 180kW with 370Nm respectively. The C 220d, the only diesel in the range, offers 125kW with torque of 400Nm. For those looking for extra performance, there are three further models to whet the appetite and, of course, they all carry the AMG nomenclature. . The AMG C 43 4MATIC is the baby of the pack with its 2996cc V6, whereas its big brothers, the AMG C63 and 63S, employ 3982cc V8s. But don t be fooled by the smaller engine, this one produces 270kW and 520Nm and puts it on the road via the 4Matic all wheel drive system. The AMG C63 provides 350kW with 650Nm while the 63 S nudges that to 375kw and 700Nm. All models with the exception of the C 200 and C 63s use the latest 9G-Tronic automatic transmission, the 200 fitted as standard with a six-speed manual gearbox. The C 63s utilise the well-proven AMG Speedshift MCT 7G-Tronic Auto transmission. The S Class Cabriolet range of fers three models the S 500 for those seeking horsepower within the confines of a luxury suite and then for those wanting all that sensuous luxury but love pushing the boundaries of performance there are two AMG derivatives the S 63 and the mighty S 65. Both the S 500 and S63 employ V8 engines, the S 500 a 4663cc unit giving 335kW with 700Nm of punch, while the S 63 houses a larger 5461cc V8 under its long bonnet and this one delivers 430 kW and 900Nm of torque. Enough power for anyone you would think, but you would be wrong. The AMG S 65 Cabriolet tops them all with the superb 5980cc V12, which is capable of providing an extremely healthy output of 463kW and enough torque to make many a truck driver weep with envy. Between 2300 and 4 300 r/min this cultured and sophisticated behemoth produces 1000Nm. All AMG variants and the S 500 employ the highly efficient bi-turbo, twin turbo charger configuration As with the C Class Cabriolets, the transmission for the S 500 is the 9G-Tronic and the S 63 and S 65 the AMG Speedshift MCT 7G-Tronic. Removing the roof from any car has inherent problems, such as loss of rigidity and an enormous weight gain when reinforcing the body to overcome that loss, and this is an area in which Mercedes have excelled. Through the use of lightweight materials both C and S Class retain the surefootedness of their sedan siblings, the rigid floorpan allowing the suspension engineers a superbly dynamic platform, with minimal weight increase. Drive any of the models and you cannot fail to be impressed by the total absence of the dreaded scuttle shake, so common in topless offerings, as well as the precise handling and excellent ride quality. . The new Cabriolets are more than motive power, especially the S Class where, as one has come to expect, a fusion of driver aids, comfort and technology provides all occupants with a level of quality that few other manufacturers can match. The S Class Cabriolet has ensured that even the climate control enhances the journey with a continuously monitored environment ensuring air quality and temperature is as requested and it does this with the hood up or lowered. The soft top is also acoustically designed therefore reducing ambient and extraneous noise to levels that allow normal conversation while travelling at high cruising speeds. As I have written so many times recently, the specifications and options for both models would fill two pages of this publication, just take it as read that both C and S Class Cabriolets can meet your every desire and probably offer some you have not even thought of. . There is no doubt in my mind that the new Mercedes-Benz C-Class and S-Class Cabriolets have raised the bar in this niche market. Once again it is the S-Class that outshines most of the opposition in this segment, particularly as a value proposition. A look at the prices realised by similar models produced at the Stuttgart plant in the 1960s and 70s will prove the point and I don t doubt that the latest generation will continue this trend.
